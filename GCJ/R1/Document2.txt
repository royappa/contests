- A flavor MUST be malted if it is the ONLY flavor liked by some customer(s)
- For any customer liking both, we can satisfy them with non-malted version
- And, a customer can like only ONE malted flavor. So it's not like they can prefer TWO malted flavors and we can satisfy them with one of those. They can only like ONE malted flavor, and if it's the only thing they like, then we must malt it.

So, find the flavors which MUST be malted. 
If there is some customer who ONLY likes the unmalted version of these must-malted flavors, then this situation is IMPOSSIBLE.
