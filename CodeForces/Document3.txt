3*r-1 <= n

3*r <= n-1
r <= (n-1)/3

r rooms = 2*r cards
ceil = r-1
2*r+r-1 = 3*r-1 per floor of r rooms, r >= 1

sum (3*r-1)  for various r

if there are h floors

then n = 3*(r1+r2+..rh)-h
where r1 > r2 > .. > rh

n-h mod 3 = 0

and nh-h div 3 is brken up into r1 > r2 > .. > rh

What is the smallest possible bottom floor?
