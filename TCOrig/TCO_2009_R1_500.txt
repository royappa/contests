Problem Statement
    
M integers are randomly independently chosen from the interval lowerBound...upperBound, inclusive. 

Return the probability that the K-th smallest element of the generated set is equal to N. 

K=1 refers to the smallest element, K=2 refers to the second smallest element, and so on.

There are 8 ways to choose 3 numbers from the interval 1..2:
Numbers | 2nd smallest element
 1 1 1  |  1
 1 1 2  |  1
 1 2 1  |  1
 1 2 2  |  2
 2 1 1  |  1
 2 1 2  |  2
 2 2 1  |  2
 2 2 2  |  2
Exactly 4 of the ways have the 2nd smallest element equal to 2.
