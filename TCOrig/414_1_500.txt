Problem Statement
    
A string S is an interspersal of a set of strings W, if W is a set of disjoint subsequences of S which cover S. Less formally, S can be formed from W by partitioning each member of W into substrings, then concatenating all the substrings, while maintaining the order of the substrings within each element of W. For example, if W contains the strings {"DESIGN", "ALGORITHM", "MARATHON"}, then one possible interspersal would be "ADELGMAORARISIGNTHMTHON", formed as shown below.

 ADELGMAORARISIGNTHMTHON 
 
Given a vector <string> W, return the lexicographically minimum interspersal of the strings in W
Definition
    
Class:
StringInterspersal
Method:
minimum
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
string
Method signature:
string minimum(vector <string> W)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
The lexicographically minimum of two strings is the one with the alphabetically earlier character at the first position at which they differ.
-
The return string will contain no more than 1000 characters.
Constraints
-
W will contain between 1 and 20 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of W will contain between 1 and 50 uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'), inclusive.
