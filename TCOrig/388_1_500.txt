Problem Statement
    
You wish to share as many facts as possible with a group of N people, but you only have time to tell one fact to each person in the group. When you tell someone a fact, you also instruct them to tell all their friends. However, the friends do not tell their friends: if A and B are friends, B and C are friends, but A and C are not friends, then after telling the fact to A it will be passed on to B but not to C. You must tell each fact to enough people so that every person either hears the fact from you, or is a friend of someone who heard it from you.
friends contains N strings of N characters, each of which is either 'Y' or 'N'. The jth character of the ith element is 'Y' if members i and j are friends, and 'N' otherwise. Determine the maximum number of facts that can be shared with every person in the group.
