Problem Statement
    
A big box contains marbles of one or more colors. 

You're given a vector <int> colors, each element of which denotes the number of marbles there are of a particular color. 

You draw n marbles randomly from the box, leaving each marble outside the box after taking it. 

Return the probability that all marbles drawn will be the same color.


Definition
    
Class:
DrawingMarbles
Method:
sameColor
Parameters:
vector <int>, int
Returns:
double
Method signature:
double sameColor(vector <int> colors, int n)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Every time we draw a marble, all marbles in the box are equally likely to be chosen.
-
A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.
Constraints
-
colors will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of colors will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-
n will be between 1 and the sum of all elements of colors, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{ 13 }
8
Returns: 1.0
All the marbles are the same color, so obviously all drawn marbles will be the same color too.
1)

    
{ 5, 7 }
1
Returns: 1.0

2)

    
{ 5, 6, 7 }
2
Returns: 0.3006535947712418
The probability that the first drawn marble will be of the color 0 is 5 / 18 (there are 5 marbles of color 0 out of 18). If the first drawn marble is of the color 0, then the probability that the second drawn marble will be of the color 0 is 4 / 17 (there are 4 marbles of color 0 left out of 17). So the probability that both drawn marbles will be of the color 0 is (5 / 18) * (4 / 17) = 0.0653594771... . Similarly, the probability that both drawn marbles will be of the color 1 is (6 / 18) * (5 / 17) = 0.0980392156..., and that both drawn marbles will be of the color 2 is (7 / 18) * (6 / 17) = 0.1372549019... . The answer is the sum of these 3 probabilities.
