Problem Statement
    
A prefix-free set is a set of words in which no element is a prefix of another element in the set. For example {"hello"} , {"hello", "goodbye", "giant", "hi"} and the empty set are examples of prefix-free sets. On the other hand, {"hello","hell"} and {"great","gig","g"} are not prefix-free.
You will be given a vector <string> words containing a set of words, and you must return the number of subsets of words that are prefix-free. Note that both the empty set and the entire set count as subsets.
Definition
    
Class:
PrefixFreeSubsets
Method:
cantPrefFreeSubsets
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
long long
Method signature:
long long cantPrefFreeSubsets(vector <string> words)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
A prefix of a string is the result of erasing zero or more characters from the right end of that string.
Constraints
-
words will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of words will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character of each element of words will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').
-
No two elements of words will be equal.
Examples
0)

    
{"hello","hell","hi"}
Returns: 6
There are 2^3=8 possible subsets. Only the subsets containing both "hello" and "hell" will not be prefix-free. There are 2 of those (one with "hi" and one without), and therefore, there are 8-2=6 prefix-free subsets.
1)

    
{"a","b","c","d"}
Returns: 16
All subsets are prefix-free.
2)

    
{"a","ab","abc","abcd","abcde","abcdef"}
Returns: 7
Only subsets with one or less elements are prefix-free.
3)

    
{"a","b","aa","ab","ba","bb"}
Returns: 25
