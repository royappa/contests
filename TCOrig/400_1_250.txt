Problem Statement
    
NOTE: This problem statement contains superscripts that may not display properly if viewed outside of the applet.

A number which can be represented as p^q, where p is a prime number and q is an integer greater than 0, is called a prime power. 

If q is larger than 1, we call the number a strong prime power. 

You are given an integer n. If n is a strong prime power, return an vector <int> containing exactly two elements. 

The first element is p and the second element is q. If n is not a strong prime power, return an empty vector <int>.

Definition

Examples
0)

    
"27"
Returns: {3, 3 }
27 = 33. This is a strong prime power.
1)

    
"10"
Returns: { }
10 = 2 * 5. This is not a strong prime power.
2)

    
"7"
Returns: { }
A prime number is not a strong prime power.
3)

    
"1296"
Returns: { }

4)

    
"576460752303423488"
Returns: {2, 59 }

5)

    
"999999874000003969"
Returns: {999999937, 2 }
