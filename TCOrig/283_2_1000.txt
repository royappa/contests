Problem Statement
    
The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers a and b is the largest integer that evenly divides both a and b. In this problem, you will find the GCD of a positive integer and the factorial of a non-negative integer.
Create a class FactorialGCD with method factGCD which takes an int a and an int b as parameters and returns the GCD of a! (the factorial of a) and b.
Definition

(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Assume 0! = 1.

-
b will be between 1 and 2147483647, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
5
20
Returns: 20
5! = 120, so GCD(120,20) = 20.
1)

    
7
5040
Returns: 5040
7! = 5040, GCD(5040,5040) = 5040.
2)

    
0
2425
Returns: 1
Note that 0! = 1.
3)

    
667024
1
Returns: 1

4)

    
4
40
Returns: 8
4! = 24, so GCD(24,40) = 8.
5)
