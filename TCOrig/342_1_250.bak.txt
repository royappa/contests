Problem Statement
    
In the first half of the 20th century, around the time that Tagalog became the national language of the Philippines, a standardized alphabet was introduced to be used in Tagalog school books (since then, the national language has changed to a hybrid "Pilipino" language, as Tagalog is only one of several major languages spoken in the Philippines).

Tagalog's 20-letter alphabet is as follows:
a b k d e g h i l m n ng o p r s t u w y

Note that not all letters used in English are present, 'k' is the third letter, and 'ng' is a single letter that comes between 'n' and 'o'.

You are compiling a Tagalog dictionary, and for people to be able to find words in it, the words need to be sorted in alphabetical order with reference to the Tagalog alphabet. Given a list of Tagalog words as a vector <string>, return the same list in Tagalog alphabetical order.
Definition
    
Class:
TagalogDictionary
Method:
sortWords
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
vector <string>
Method signature:
vector <string> sortWords(vector <string> words)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Any 'n' followed followed by a 'g' should be considered a single 'ng' letter (the one that comes between 'n' and 'o').
Constraints
-
words will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of words will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each character of each element of words will be a valid lowercase letter that appears in the Tagalog alphabet.
-
Each element of words will be distinct.
