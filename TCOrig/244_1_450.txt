Problem Statement
    
A "Polyline" is a continuous line composed of one or more line segments. In a rectangle defined by four points (0,0), (a, 0), (a, b), and (0, b), we can draw a polyline starting from the point (x0, y0) to the end point (x1, y1) with at least one intersection point with each of the four edges of the rectangle. Write a class Polyline with a method length that returns the shortest length of such a polyline.
Definition
    
Class:
Polyline
Method:
length
Parameters:
int, int, int, int, int, int
Returns:
double
Method signature:
double length(int a, int b, int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
The polyline must not exceed the boundaries of the given rectangle.
-
The starting point and ending point may overlap.
-
Your return value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.
Constraints
-
a and b will be between 2 and 200 inclusive.
-
x0 and x1 will be between 1 and (a-1) inclusive.
-
y0 and y1 will be between 1 and (b-1) inclusive.
