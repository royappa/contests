string describe(string s) 
{
}

Problem Statement
    
A string is called ugly if it has 3 vowels in a row, or 5 consonants in a row, or both. A string is called nice if it is not ugly. You are given a string s, consisting of uppercase letters ('A'-'Z') and question marks ('?'). Return "UGLY" if the string is definitely ugly (that means you cannot substitute letters for question marks so that the string becomes nice), "NICE" if the string is definitely nice, and "42" if it can be either ugly or nice 
(quotes for clarity only).
