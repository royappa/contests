Problem Statement
    
There is a number of people in a room, and each of them wears a hat which is either black or white. 

Every person counts the number of other people wearing white hats. 

You are given a vector <int> count, the i-th element of which is the number counted by the i-th person. 

Return the total number of people wearing white hats, or -1 if count doesn't correspond to a valid situation.

Definition
    
Class:

Method:
whiteNumber
Parameters:
vector <int>
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int whiteNumber(vector <int> count)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
count will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of count will be between 0 and 50, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{2,1,1}
Returns: 2
The first person wears a black hat and sees two people wearing white hats. Each person wearing a white hat sees only one other white hat in the room.
1)

    
{2,2,2}
Returns: 3
Everyone wears a white hat here.

Black hats only.
3)

    
{1,1,1,2}

{10,10}
Returns: -1
Now that's interesting. There are only two people in the room, yet each of them counted 10 others.
