Problem Statement
    
You are given a vector <string> patterns, each element of which is a single pattern. Each pattern contains only lowercase letters and question marks ('?'). A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. For example, "abc" matches "a?c", but not "a?b" or "abc?". Return the number of strings consisting of only lowercase letters that match exactly k of the given patterns, modulo 1,000,003.
Definition
    
Class:
SetOfPatterns
Method:
howMany
Parameters:
vector <string>, int
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int howMany(vector <string> patterns, int k)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
patterns will contain between 1 and 15 elements, inclusive.
-
k will be between 1 and the number of elements in patterns, inclusive.
-
Each element of patterns will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each element of patterns will have the same length.
-
Each element of patterns will contain only lowercase letters ('a' - 'z') and question marks ('?').
Examples
0)

    
{"?"}
1
Returns: 26
Every lowercase letter matches this pattern.
1)

    
{"a","b","c"}
1
Returns: 3
"a" or "b" or "c".
2)

    
{"a?","?b"}
2
Returns: 1
The only possible solution is "ab".
3)

    
{"?????"}
1
Returns: 881343
26^5 mod 1000003 = 881343.
