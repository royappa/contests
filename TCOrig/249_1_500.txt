Problem Statement
    
A group of people have participated in an online chat session. 

Element i (0-based) of numSeen contains the number of lines of chat seen by person i before leaving (everyone arrives at the same time). 

More precisely, integer j in element i of numSeen is the exact number of lines written by person j that are seen by person i before leaving. 

Integer i of element i will always be 0, and should be ignored. 

You will return a vector <int> containing the order in which each person left. 

If multiple orders are possible, return the one that occurs first lexicographically. 

If none are possible, return an empty vector <int>.
Definition
    
Class:
ChatExit
Method:
leaveOrder
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
vector <int>
Method signature:
vector <int> leaveOrder(vector <string> numSeen)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Order A comes lexicographically before order B if A has a lower value than B in the first position that they disagree.
Constraints
-
numSeen will contain between 2 and 25 elements inclusive.
-
Each element of numSeen will contain between 3 and 50 characters inclusive.
-
Each element of numSeen will be a single space delimited list of integers. Each integer will be between 0 and 100 inclusive, and will have no extra leading zeros.
-
Each element of numSeen will contain exactly k integers, where k is the number of elements in numSeen.
-
Integer i in element i of numSeen will always be 0.
Examples
0)

    
{
"0 1 1",
"2 0 0",
"3 1 0"
}
Returns: {1, 0, 2 }
A possible sequence of events is: Person 0 writes a line. Person 1 writes a line. Person 0 writes a line. Person 1 leaves. Person 2 writes a line. Person 0 writes a line. Person 0 leaves. Person 2 leaves. 
1)

    
{
"0 1 1",
"4 0 0",
"3 1 0"
}
Returns: { }
No order is possible here due to the following requirements:
Person 1 must see 4 lines from person 0, but person 2 must only see 3 lines from person 0.
Person 0 must see 1 line from person 2, but person 1 must not see any.
The first item above forces person 1 to leave after person 2. The second item forces person 1 to leave before person 2.
2)

    
{
"0 100 100 100 100 100",
"100 0 100 100 100 100",
"100 100 0 100 100 100",
"100 100 100 0 100 100",
"100 100 100 100 0 100",
"100 100 100 100 100 0"
}
Returns: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
Everyone says exactly 100 lines. Any leaving order is possible. The lexicographically first order is returned.
3)

    
{
"0 1 0 0",
"1 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0"
}
Returns: {2, 3, 0, 1 }

4)

    
{
"0 0 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0 0",
"0 0 0 0 0"
}
Returns: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }
