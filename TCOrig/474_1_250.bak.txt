Problem Statement
    
Little Dazdraperma likes to travel a lot. One day she made a route in an N-dimensional space. In this space each point is represented by N coordinates. The coordinates are indexed from 1 to N, inclusive. 

She started from the origin, i.e., a point where each coordinate is 0. Then she did several moves of the following type:
* First she chose a coordinate index, i.e., a number between 1 and N, inclusive.
* Then she jumped to a point where the coordinate with the chosen index is either increased or decreased by 1 and all other coordinates remain the same.


Now Dazdraperma wonders whether she has ever visited the same point twice. 

You will be given a vector <int> coords and a string moves representing her route. 

The i-th element of coords is the coordinate index she has chosen during her i-th move. 

If the coordinate with this index was increased during the i-th move, the i-th character of moves will be '+', and it will be '-' if this coordinate was decreased.  

Return "VALID" if all points of her route were unique, including the first and the last points, and return "NOT VALID" otherwise. Two points A and B in N-dimensional space are different if there's an index i such that A's coordinate with index i and B's coordinate with index i are different.

-
coords will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.

Examples
0)

    
1
{1}
"+"
Returns: "VALID"
Dazdraperma starts at (0) and then jumps to (1). The answer is "VALID".
1)

    
2
{1,2,1,2}
"++--"
Returns: "NOT VALID"
The route goes through 5 points: (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0). The point (0,0) was visited twice.
2)

    
3
{1,2,3,1,2}
"+++--"
Returns: "VALID"
(0,0,0) -> (1,0,0) -> (1,1,0) -> (1,1,1) -> (0,1,1) -> (0,0,1).
3)

    
344447
{132,51717,628,344447,628,51717,344447,2}
"+-++-+--"
Returns: "NOT VALID"
The repeated point doesn't have to be the first or the last point in the route.
4)

    
1
{1,1}
"+-"
Returns: "NOT VALID"
