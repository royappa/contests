Problem Statement
    
Bob's father bought him a toy map of islands and seas. The map is a two-dimensional grid where each cell is either 'x' or '.'. A sea is defined as a maximal connected group of '.' cells, where two '.' cells are connected if they are vertically or horizontally adjacent. An island is defined as a maximal connected group of 'x' cells, where two 'x' cells are connected if they are vertically, horizontally, or diagonally adjacent. An island has a level of 0 if it contains no other islands. An island has a level of K+1 if it contains one or more islands and the highest level of a contained island is K. An island A contains island B if A and B are different and, if you start sailing from any point of island B, you won't be able to sail out of island A (you can sail only horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally).
For example, the given map below has 5 islands with level 0 (islands 0 - 4 on the right picture) and one island with level 1 (island 5). Please note that starting at island 3, you can not sail outside island 5 (you can not sail diagonally), but its possible get out of island 1 when starting at island 4.
xxx.x...xxxxx        000.0...11111
xxxx....x...x        0000....1...1
........x.x.x        ........1.4.1
..xxxxx.x...x        ..55555.1...1
..x...x.xxx.x        ..5...5.111.1
..x.x.x...x..        ..5.3.5...1..
..x...x...xxx        ..5...5...111
...xxxxxx....        ...555555....
x............        2............
Given a String[] seaMap, return a int[], where the k-th element is the number of islands of level k. The int[] must contain exactly m elements, where m is the highest level of an island in the map.
