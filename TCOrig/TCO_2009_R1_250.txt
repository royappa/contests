Problem Statement
    
Given a number N and a length L, find the shortest list of at least L consecutive non-negative integers whose sum is N. If the length of that list is 100 or smaller, return the sequence as a vector <int> in ascending order. If there is no such sequence or its length is larger than 100, return { }.
Definition
    
Class:
SequenceSums
Method:
sequence
Parameters:
int, int
Returns:
vector <int>
Method signature:
vector <int> sequence(int N, int L)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
N will be between 1 and 1000 000 000, inclusive.
-
L will be between 2 and 100, inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
18
2
Returns: {5, 6, 7 }
18 can be expressed as 5 + 6 + 7 or 3 + 4 + 5 + 6. Both of these lists contain more than 2 elements, so you should return the shortest among them.
1)

    
18
4
Returns: {3, 4, 5, 6 }
Now the correct answer is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 because 5 + 6 + 7 contains less than 4 elements.
2)

    
18
5
Returns: { }
Both possible presentations of 18 contain less than 5 elements, so there's no answer for this case.
3)

    
45
10
Returns: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }

4)

    
1000000000
2
Returns: {199999998, 199999999, 200000000, 200000001, 200000002 }
