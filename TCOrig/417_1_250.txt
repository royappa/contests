Problem Statement
    
In this problem you will be given a string text and you will need to find the substring of the text that matches a given template in the best way. The template will be represented by two strings: prefix and suffix. 

Consider a string S. The prefix match score of S with respect to a given template is the maximal n >= 0 such that the first n characters of S are equal to the last n characters of prefix and occur in the same exact order. 

Analogously, the suffix match score of S is the maximal m >= 0 such that the last m characters of S are equal to the first m characters of suffix and occur in the same exact order.
 
For example, if S = "something", prefix = "awesome", and suffix = "ingenious", than the prefix score of S is 4 (the matched characters are "some") and the suffix score is 3 (the matched characters are "ing").
 
The match score of a string S with respect to a given template is the sum of its prefix and suffix match scores. 

Find the non-empty substring of text with the maximal match score according to the template (prefix, suffix). 

In case of a tie, return the substring with the maximal prefix score. 

If there are still several candidates, return one that comes first lexicographically.


Definition
    
Class:
TemplateMatching
Method:
bestMatch
Parameters:
string, string, string
Returns:
string
Method signature:
string bestMatch(string text, string prefix, string suffix)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
String A comes before string B lexicographically if A is a proper prefix of B, or if A has a smaller character at the first position where the strings differ. When comparing the characters, refer to the following list of characters in ascending order: ' ', 'a', 'b', ..., 'z'.
Constraints
-
text will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
prefix will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
suffix will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
text, prefix and suffix will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z') and spaces (' ').
Examples
0)

    
"something"
"awesome"
"ingenious"
Returns: "something"
The example from the problem statement.
1)

    
"havka"
"eto"
"papstvo"
Returns: "a"
The return value must be non-empty string, so the correct answer is "a".
2)

    
"abracadabra"
"habrahabr"
"bracket"
Returns: "abrac"

3)

    
"mississippi"
"promise"
"piccolo"
Returns: "ippi"

4)

    
"a a a a a a"
"a a"
"a"
Returns: "a a"

5)

    
"ab"
"b"
"a"
Returns: "b"
