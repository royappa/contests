Problem Statement
    
You have a rectangular chocolate bar that consists of width x height square tiles. You can split it into two rectangular pieces by creating a single vertical or horizontal break along tile edges. For example, a 2 x 2 chocolate bar can be divided into two 2 x 1 pieces, but it cannot be divided into two pieces, where one of them is 1 x 1. You can repeat the split operation as many times as you want, each time splitting a single rectangular piece into two rectangular pieces. Your goal is to create a piece consisting of exactly nTiles tiles. Return the minimal number of split operations necessary to reach this goal. If it is impossible, return -1.
