Problem Statement
    
John and Brus are studying string theory at the university. Their task is to create a list of all the palindromes that contain between 1 and n lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Additionally, each palindrome in their list must contain no more than k distinct letters. Return the number of palindromes in the list modulo 1234567891.
