Problem Statement
    
You are given a set A of integers and a positive integer n. 

You must find positive integers x, y and z such that their product is as close to n as possible (minimize |n - x * y * z|), and none of them belongs to A. 

If there are several such triples, find the one with the smallest x. 

If there are still several such triples, minimize y. If there is still a tie, minimize z.

You are given the elements of A as a vector <int> a. 

Return a vector <int> with exactly three elements: x, y and z, in this order.

Examples
0)

    
{2,4}
4
Returns: {1, 1, 3 }
You can get 3=1*1*3 and 5=1*1*5. 3 is better.
1)

    
{1}
10
Returns: {2, 2, 2 }

2)

    
{1,2}
10
Returns: {3, 3, 3 }

3)

    
{1,3}
12
Returns: {2, 2, 2 }

4)

    
{1,3}
