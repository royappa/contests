Problem Statement
    
We generate two infinitely long numbers. The first number is generated by writing down all positive consecutive integers, while the second is generated by writing down all of their squares. We then find the sum of these two numbers. Here are the first 33 digits of the calculation:
  123456789101112131415161718192021...
+ 149162536496481100121144169196225...
= 272619325597593231536305887388246...
The first digit of the result is 2, the second digit is 7, the third is 2 and so on.
Given an int k, return the digit at position k of the resulting number, where the first digit is at position 1.
