Problem Statement
    
A string X is an ordered superstring of the vector <string> words if
* Each element of words is a substring of X.
* There exists a sequence of indices x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n, where n is the number of elements in words. 
For each element k of words, where k is a 1-based index, there is an occurrence of words[k] that starts at the x_k-th letter of X.
For example "abca" is an ordered superstring of {"abc", "ca"}, but "cabc" is not.
Given a vector <string> words, return the length of its shortest ordered superstring.
Definition
    
Class:
OrderedSuperString
Method:
getLength
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int getLength(vector <string> words)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
words will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of words will contain between 1 and 50 lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
{"abc","ca"}
Returns: 4
This is the example from the problem statement. The shortest ordered superstring is "abca". The sequence of indices is {0, 2}. There is an occurrence of "abc" starting at character 0 of "abca", and there is an occurrence of "ca" starting at character 2 of "abca".
1)

    
{"a","a","b","a"}
Returns: 3
Although the given words are all substrings of "ab", they do not appear in the proper order. The shortest ordered superstring is "aba".
2)

    
{"abcdef", "ab","bc", "de","ef"}
Returns: 6

3)

    
{"ab","bc", "de","ef","abcdef"}
Returns: 12
