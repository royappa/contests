Problem Statement
    
You are given a vector <int> elements. If the arithmetic mean of a non-empty subset of elements is between L and H, inclusive, the subset is considered "good". A subset of a vector <int> is obtained by removing 0 or more elements from the vector <int>. Return the number of "good" subsets.
Definition
    
Class:
ArithmeticalMean
Method:
howMany
Parameters:
vector <int>, int, int
Returns:
long long
Method signature:
long long howMany(vector <int> elements, int L, int H)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
elements will contain between 1 and 36 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of elements will be between -25000000 and 25000000, inclusive.
-
Each element of elements will be distinct.
-
L and H will each be between -25000000 and 25000000, inclusive.
-
L will not be greater than H.
Examples
0)

    
{10,1,3}
2
6
Returns: 4
All possible arithmetic means are: 1, 2, 3, 14/3, 11/2, 13/2, 10. Four of them (2, 3, 14/2, 11/2) make "good" subsets.
1)

    
{0}
-1
0
Returns: 1
There is just one subset and it's "good".
2)

    
{0}
100
100
Returns: 0
Same one subset but it's not "good".
3)

    
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
3
7
Returns: 949
