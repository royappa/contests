Problem Statement
    
John and Brus are studying string theory at the university. Their task is to create a list of all the palindromes that contain between 1 and n lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Additionally, each palindrome in their list must contain no more than k distinct letters. Return the number of palindromes in the list modulo 1234567891.

count
Parameters:
int, int
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int count(int n, int k)
(be sure your method is public)

Examples
0)

    
1
1
Returns: 26
All palindromes in the list are single character strings.
1)

    
2
10
Returns: 52
Now we have single and double character palindromes.
2)

    
3
2
Returns: 728
A slightly longer list.
3)

    
44
7
Returns: 240249781
