int bounces(int rows, int columns, int startrow, int startcol, vector <string> holes) {
	
}

Problem Statement
    
A ball is moving diagonally on a rectangular board composed of unit squares in rows rows and columns columns. Each square is identified by its row and column number. The lowermost row is marked row 0 and the leftmost column is column 0.
The ball is initially located in the middle of a starting square given by two integers, startrow and startcol, and is moving diagonally up-right at an angle of 45 degrees. Whenever it reaches a wall, it bounces off it at a right angle (an angle of 90 degrees) and continues moving. If the ball runs into a corner, it bounces back in the opposite direction from which it came..
 
A number of holes have been drilled in the board and the ball will fall in upon reaching a square with a hole. Given the board size, starting location and locations of holes, return the number of times the ball will bounce off a wall before falling into a hole, or -1 if the ball will continue bouncing indefinitely.
Definition
    
Class:
BallBouncing
Method:
bounces
Parameters:
int, int, int, int, vector <string>
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int bounces(int rows, int columns, int startrow, int startcol, vector <string> holes)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Bouncing back from a corner counts as only one bounce.
Constraints
-
rows and columns will be between 1 and 1000000, inclusive.
-
startrow will be between 0 and rows-1, inclusive.
-
startcol will be between 0 and columns-1, inclusive.
-
holes will contain between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of holes will be formatted as "row column" (quotes for clarity), where row and column will be integers with no leading zeros representing a square inside the board.
-
There will be no holes at the starting position of the ball.
-
No two holes will occupy the same position on the board.
