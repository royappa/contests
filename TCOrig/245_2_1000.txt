Problem Statement
    
You are a playing a card game consisting of 1 or more rounds in which you may purchase 1 or more cards during each round. 

The cost of buying c cards in round r is k^r * c^2 (in the first round, r = 0). 

For example, if k = 2, and you buy 4 cards in the first round, 1 card in the second round, and 1 card in the third round, it would cost:
2^0 * 4^2 = 16 for the first four cards,
2^1 * 1^2 = 2 for the fifth card,
2^2 * 1^2 = 4 for the last card.

The six cards cost you 22. 

There is a cheaper way to buy 6 cards: buy 3, then 2, then 1 for a cost of 9+8+4 = 21. 

Suppose you wish to buy n cards given some round multipler k. Return the minimum cost of purchasing the cards.
