Problem Statement
    
State machines occur frequently in computer science literature. At any given point in time, a state machine is in a particular state p. After receiving an input symbol, the machine updates its state. The potential input symbols in this problem are 0, 1, 2, or 3. The vector <string> transitions describes how the state machine M behaves. Each element of transitions will contain 4 space delimited integers. The integers in element i (0-based) describe how M reacts to input while in state i. For example, if element 3 is "0 4 2 3", then M will transition from state 3 to state 0, 4, 2, or 3 depending on whether 0, 1, 2, or 3 are received as input, respectively.  Our state machine M is unfortunately out of control. We do not know which state M is currently in. To rectify the situation, we want to find a string s and a state h such that, after feeding s into M one symbol at a time, M will definitely be in state h. Considering all possible pairs of s and h, return the length of the shortest s. If no such pairs exist, return -1.
Definition
    
Class:
SequenceSync
Method:
getLength
Parameters:
vector <string>
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int getLength(vector <string> transitions)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
transitions will contain between 1 and 20 elements inclusive.
-
Each element of transitions will have the form "w x y z" where w, x, y, and z are integers, without extra leading zeros, between 0 and k-1 inclusive. Here k is the number of elements in transitions.
Examples
0)

    
{"1 1 1 1",
 "1 1 1 2",
 "0 2 2 2"}
Returns: 2
The string "33" forces the machine into state 2.
1)

    
{"1 1 1 1",
 "2 2 2 2",
 "3 3 3 3",
 "0 0 0 0"}
Returns: -1
There are no strings that work here.
2)

    
{"0 0 0 0"}
Returns: 0
A string of length 0 works here.
3)

    
{"1 1 1 0",
 "2 2 2 1",
 "3 3 3 2",
 "4 4 4 3",
 "5 5 5 5",
 "6 6 6 6",
 "7 7 7 0",
 "0 0 0 8",
 "8 8 8 8",
 "9 9 9 8"}
Returns: 15
