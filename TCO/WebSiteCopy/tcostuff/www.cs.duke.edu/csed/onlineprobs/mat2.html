<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

You are given a picture that needs to be colored in.  To aid in the
coloring process, color clues have been placed in the picture.  To color
a particular region of the picture you must first locate the color clue
with the highest value within the region.  In case of a tie the leftmost
clue is chosen from among the highest.  For example:
<PRE>

XXXXXXXXXX   
...2.X....   
.2...X..2.    
...0.XXXXX      'X's are boundaries
..1..X....      '.'s are blanks  
.3...X....
....3X....
XXXXXXXXXX

</PRE>

Above there are 3 regions: the left, the upper right, and the lower
right.  The lower right has no clues.  The left does have clues so first
we find the highest clue value(3).  There is a tie between two 3s in the
region so the leftmost 3 is chosen.  The upper right does have a clue
and we choose the highest clue, which is also the only clue in the
region(2).
<P>

Once we have chosen a clue for a region we ignore all other clues in
that region.  Next, the point with the chosen clue on it is given the
color value of the clue.  The picture before would now look like this
once we have 1)chosen clues, 2)ignored the unchosen, and 3)given the
points corresponding to the chosen clues the corresponding color values:
<PRE>

XXXXXXXXXX   
.....X....   
.....X..2.    
.....XXXXX      'X's are boundaries
.....X....      '.'s are blanks  
.3...X....
.....X....
XXXXXXXXXX

</PRE>

Finally we must ensure that the following criteria hold for the region:
<OL>
<LI> All points in a region with the same horizontal coordinate share the same color value.  
<LI> A point in the region one step to the left of another point in the region must have a color value lower by one.  
<LI> A point in the region one step to the right of another point in the region must have a color value higher by one.
</OL>
The picture used before would be colored as follows:
<PRE>

XXXXXXXXXX   
23456X0123   
23456X0123   
23456XXXXX      'X's are boundaries
23456X....      '.'s are blanks  
23456X....
23456X....
XXXXXXXXXX

</PRE>
As can be seen, the coloring method creates something of a color
gradient in each region.  The region on the lower right had no color
clues so it could not be colored and remains blank.  Also note that all
shading ends at the boundaries of the picture.  It is as if there is an
imaginary boundary around the outside of the picture.  In other words,
all regions that touch the edge of the picture end at the edge of the
picture.
<P>
Your method will color all of the regions in the picture that can be
colored, and will then return the sum of all of the colors values in the
picture not including blank regions and boundaries.  In the above
example it would be: 6*(2+3+4+5+6) + 2*(0+1+2+3) = 132 Since the blank
region and boundaries were disregarded, and there are 6 rows of
2+3+4+5+6 in the left region and 2 rows of 0+1+2+3 in the upper right
region.
<P>
Two points are in the same region if and only if there exists a path
between them that does not cross a boundary.  This path can only consist
of vertical and horizontal moves (no one step diagonal moves).  This
path must not contain boundary symbols and cannot leave the picture.
<P>

Create a class NumberFill that contains the method gradient, which takes
a <tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt>
picture and returns the sum of all colors values within
the picture once all regions that should be filled have been properly
filled.  Boundary points and blank regions are not included in the
summation calculation.




<P>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<UL>
<LI> Class: NumberFill
<LI> Method: gradient
<LI> Parameters: <tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt>
<LI> Returns: int
Method signature (be sure your method is public):  
<PRE>
  int gradient(tvector&lt;string&gt; picture);
</PRE>
</UL>
<h3>Prototype</h3>
<PRE>
 #include <string>
 using namespace std;
 #include "tvector.h"

 class NumberFill
 {
   public:
     int gradient(tvector&lt;string&gt; picture)
     {
         // fill in this function (and others you can write)
     }
 };


</PRE>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Boundaries are represented by 'X' characters.
<LI> Color clues are represented by characters '0'..'9' inclusive.
<LI> Blank spots on the board are represented by '.' characters.

<LI> Due to the nature of the process, negative color values and color
values greater than 9 can occur in the picture after the gradient has
been computed (see example 6 for more on negative color values)


</UL>

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> All characters in picture are either 'X', '.', or '0'..'9'
	inclusive (single quotes for clarity)
<P>
<LI> All elements of picture will have the same length.
<LI> All elements of picture will have length between 1 and 20 inclusive
<LI> picture will contain between 1 and 20 elements inclusive
</UL>

</UL>
<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL type='0'>
<LI>
<PRE>
 picture = {
"..X.....",
"..X..0..",
"1.X.....",
"..X.....",
"........"}

return 168

</PRE>

The highest clue in the region is the 1 so it is chosen.
The final picture would look like:
<PRE>
12X45678
12X45678
12X45678 
12X45678 
12345678 
</PRE>
The return value is thus: 5*(1+2+4+5+6+7+8)+3 = 168

<LI>
<PRE>
 picture = {
"5.X.....",
"..X..3..",
"..X.....",
"..X.....",
"..X....."}

return 130
</PRE>

There are two regions in this picture: the left and the right.
The highest clue in the left region is the 5 so it is chosen.
The highest clue in the right region is the 3 so it is chosen.
The final picture would look like:
<PRE>
56X12345
56X12345
56X12345
56X12345
56X12345
</PRE>
The return value is thus: 5*(5+6+1+2+3+4+5) = 130

<LI>

<PRE>
 picture = {
"........",
"........",
"........",
"........"}

return 0

</pre>
There are no clues in the region so it is left blank.

<LI>
<PRE>
 picture = {"...3"}

 return 6

</PRE>
The highest clue in the region is the 3 so it is chosen. 
The final picture would look like:
<PRE>
0123
</PRE>
The return value is thus 0+1+2+3 = 6

<P>

<LI>
<PRE>
picture = {".3....3"}

return 35
</PRE>

Two clues of value 3 are tied for the highest clue in the region.  The
leftmost 3 is chosen.  The final picture would look like: 
<PRE>
2345678 
</PRE>
The
return value is thus 2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

picture = {"......0"}

return -21


</PRE>
The highest clue in the region is the 0 so it is chosen.
The final picture would look like:
<PRE>
-6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0
</PRE>
The return value is thus -6+-5+-4+-3+-2+-1+0 = -21


</OL>
