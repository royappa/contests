<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Given a rectangular object and several boxes (in this problem, we ignore
the height of the box, so a box only has two dimensions) of different
sizes, you want to find the box with the smallest area which is large
enough to contain the object. When putting the object in the box, it's
sides must be parallel with the sides of the box. Thus, you may only
rotate the object 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees (although for obvious
reasons you only need to consider rotating with 0 and 90 degrees).
<P>

Create a function smallestBox
which takes an int objWidth, an int objLength (the width and length of
the object), a tvector&lt;int&gt; boxWidth, 
a tvector&lt;int&gt; boxLength (the width and length
of the boxes) and returns an int, the area of the smallest box that can
fit the object. Element i in boxWidth and boxLength correspond to box
i. If no box is big enough to contain the object, return -1.
<P>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<UL>    
<LI> Class: none used in this problem
<LI> Method: smallestBox
<LI> Parameters: int, int, tvector&lt;int&gt; tvector&lt;int&gt;
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature: 
<PRE>
int smallestBox(int objWidth, int objLength, 
                tvector&lt;int&gt; boxWidth,
                tvector&lt;int&gt; boxLength)
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>

<h3>Class</h3>
<PRE>
 #include "tvector.h"
 int smallestBox(int objWidth, int objLength, 
                 tvector&lt;int&gt; boxWidth,
                 tvector&lt;int&gt; boxLength)
 {
     // fill in body of this function
 }

</PRE>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<P>
There doesn't have to be any gap between the sides of an object and the
sides of the box. Thus, an object with width 5 and length 7 will fit in
a box with width 7 and length 5.-Return -1 if there is no box big enough
to contain the object (see example 1). 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> 
objWidth will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
<LI>
objLength will be
between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
<LI> boxWidth will contain between 1 and 50
elements, inclusive.
<LI> boxLength will contain between 1 and 50 elements,
inclusive.
<LI> boxWidth will contain the same number of elements as
boxLength.
<LI>
Each element in boxWidth will be between 1 and 1000,
inclusive.
<LI>Each element in boxLength will be between 1 and 1000,
inclusive.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<PRE>

7

3

{3}

{7}
</PRE>

Returns: 21
<P>
By rotating the object 90 degrees we can precisely fit it into the only
box in the list, so the method should return 21 (7*3).
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

5

8

{6,9,3}

{7,4,5}

</PRE>

Returns: -1
<P>
The object can't fit in any of the boxes, no matter if we rotate it or
not. The method should thus return -1.
<P>
<LI>

<PRE>

17

5

{19,10,12,40}

{12,20,15,5}

</PRE>

Returns: 200
<P>
The object will fit in box 0, 1 and 3. The area of box 1 and 3 are 200
while the area of box 0 is 228, so the method should return 200.
