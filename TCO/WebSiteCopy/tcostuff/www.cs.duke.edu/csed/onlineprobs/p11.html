<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

In a single-elimination tournament, the schedule is determined by
placing the teams in a vertical list called "the tournament bracket". In
the first round the top two teams in the bracket play each other, then
the next two, etc. In the second round the top two remaining teams play
each other, then the next two, etc. This continues until there is only
one team left -- the tournament winner.
<P>
The number of teams in the tournament should be a power of 2 -- if it
isn't, byes are added to the bracket. Byes are never placed so that they
will "play" each other. When a team's opponent is "bye", there is no
game played and the team automatically advances as if it had won a
game. Here is an example with a bracket of length 4 containing one bye
(see Example 0).
<PRE>


             ROUND 1       ROUND 2
      Duke
          |--------- Duke
      UCLA              |
                        |-------- MIT
      bye               |
          |---------- MIT
      MIT
</PRE>
<P>
We have the tournament bracket (including any byes) from last year's
tournament. We also have a list of the results of the games in the order
in which they were played. We want to figure out who won last year's
tournament. Create a class Tourney that contains a method winner that is
given a <code>tvector&lt;string&gt; bracket</code> 
and a <code>string results</code> and that returns the name
of the winning team as a <code>string</code>. 
The bracket is given in order from top
to bottom, and the results are given as a string of 'H' or 'L'
indicating for each game (in the order in which the games were played)
whether the Higher or Lower team from the bracket won that game. results
contains a character for each real game, but not for byes.

<P> 
<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>    
<LI> Class: Tourney
<LI> Method: winner
<LI> Parameters: <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>, <code>string</code>
<LI> Returns: <code>string</code>
<LI>Method signature: 
<PRE>
    string winner(const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; bracket, const string&amp; results)
</PRE>

(be sure your method is public)
<P>    

 <h3>Class</h3>


<XMP>

#include<string>
using namespace std;
#include "tvector.h"
class Tourney
{
    public:
    string winner(const tvector<string>& bracket, 
                  const string& results)
    {
            // fill in code here
    }
};
</XMP>

<P>
<h3>Notes</h3

<UL>
<LI> It is possible that two teams with the same name could be in the
tournament.
</UL>

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> the number of elements in bracket will be a power of 2 between 2 and
32 inclusive
<P>
<LI> each element in bracket will have length between 1 and 50 inclusive
<P>
<LI> each element in bracket will contain only uppercase characters
'A'-'Z', or will be "bye"
<P>
<LI> no two bye elements will be placed such that they would play each
other
<P>
<LI> the length of results will be exactly one less than the number of
non-bye elements in bracket
<P>
<LI> each character of results will be uppercase 'H' or uppercase 'L'

</UL>

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
bracket = {"DUKE","UCLA","bye","MIT"}

results = "HL"


</PRE>

Returns:  "MIT"
<P>

DUKE played UCLA in the first round and MIT advanced with a bye. DUKE
won since the first game was won by the team higher on the bracket. In
the second round, MIT beat DUKE since the second game was won by the
lower team.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    

bracket = {"A","B","C","bye","D","E","F","bye"}

results = "LHHLH"


</PRE>

Returns "B"
<P>

  Round 1: B beat A, D beat E <br>
  Round 2: B beat C, F beat D <br>
  Round 3: B beat F <br>

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    
bracket = {"MIT","bye"}	

results = ""

</PRE>
<P>
Returns: "MIT"
<P>

<LI>
<PRE>

bracket = {"STANFORD","bye","STANFORD","bye"}

results = "L"


</PRE>
<P>
Returns: "STANFORD"
<P>

</OL>
