<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

You are trying to eat more healthy meals.  You know the nutritional
information of each of the food items you can eat.  This information
contains the number of calories in each food item, and the vitamin
content of each item - represented as the percentage of the recommended
amounts of each of 3 vitamins.
<P>

Create a class LightMeal which contains a method calories that, given a
<tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt> of food items' dietary information,
returns the number of calories in the meal you should eat that contains
the fewest calories and that provides at least 100 percent of each of
these three vitamins.
<P>

<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Class: LightMeal
<LI> Method: calories
<LI> Parameters: <code>const tvector&lt;string&gt;&map;</code>
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature 
<PRE>
   int calories(const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; items)
</PRE>
</UL>
(be sure your method is public)
<P>
<h3>Class</h3>
<XMP>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#include "tvector.h"

class LightMeal
{
  public:
    int calories(const tvector<string>& items)
    {
        // fill in code here
    }
};
</XMP>


Each element in items will be in the form of 
<PRE>
   "CALORIES VITAMIN_A VITAMIN_B VITAMIN_C" 
</PRE>
(quotes are for clarity only).  <tt>CALORIES</tt>
represents the number of calories in the item.  <tt>VITAMIN_A</tt>, 
<tt>VITAMIN_B</tt> and 
<tt>VITAMIN_C</tt> each represent the percent of the recommended amount
of each vitamin the item contains.

<P>
<h3>Constraints and Notes</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Meals with more than 100 percent of one or more vitamins are fine.
Your concern is only to find the meal with at least 100 percent of each
vitamin and the minimum number of calories.  
<P>
<LI> You can not eat part of
an item, nor can you eat more than one of each item.  You must either
eat the entire single item, or none of it.
<P>
<LI> <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; items</code> will contain between
1 and 20 elements, inclusive.  
<P>
<LI> Each element of parameter
<tt>items</tt> will be between 7 and 50 characters in length, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> Each element of parameter <tt>items</tt> will contain 4
non-negative integers each separated by a single space.  Each of these
numbers will be between 0 and 1000, inclusive.
<P>
<LI>  Each element of parameter <tt>items</tt> will contain only digits '0'-'9' and spaces
	' '.
<P>
<LI>  Each element of parameter <tt>items</tt> will neither start nor
	end with a space.
<P>
<LI> There will be at least one combination of items that will provide
at least 100% of each of the 3 vitamins.
</UL>

<h3>Examples</h3>

In each of these examples, quotes ('"'), commas (','), and curly braces
('{' and '}') are included for clarity only.  They are never part of the
input or output.
<P>

</PRE>
Returns: 100
<P>
There is only one food item, and it provides at least 100% of each of
the three vitamins.  It consists of 100 calories, so return 100.
