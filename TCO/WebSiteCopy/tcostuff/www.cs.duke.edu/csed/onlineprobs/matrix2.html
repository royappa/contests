    <h1>Matrix 2, Names with Highest Score</h1>

<em>

</em>
<p>
<hr>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Your task is to return the name of the player with the highest score. If 
there is more than one player with the highest score, then you should return
a string with the names of all the players with the highest score, with 
names separated by a "-". The order of these names should be in the same
order they appear in the array they are given in. A player's name should
only appear once. 

<p>You are 
given a vector called <tt>names</tt> of player names and a matrix called
<tt>scores </tt> with scores for some sport, where 
each row in the matrix represents the scores of a player on 
the team and each column is the scores in a game. 
Thus, the entry <tt>scores[k][j]</tt> in the matrix is the number
of points scored by player <tt>k</tt> for game <tt>j</tt>. The corresponding
player's name is in <tt>names[k]</tt>. 
<P>


For example, suppose the game is Duke basketball,  there are 14 players on 
the team, and they have played three games so far. The first column below is 
the Names vector and the next three columns are in the matrix scores. 
<p>
<pre>
Deng         18   12    17
Horvath      17    0    17
Redick        9   16    23
Ewing        13   23    6
Melchionni   21    9    3
Dockery       9    6    4
Duhon        12   11    6
Williams     16   12   17
Borman        0    0    0
Davidson      0    0    0
Randolph     23   12   18
Thompson     15    4    0
Johnson       0    0    2
Means         0    0    0
</pre>
<P>

The string returned should be <tt>"Redick-Ewing-Randolph" </tt> as 23 is
the highest score and those are the three players with the highest score.
Note there is no dash after Randolph.
