<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

You just got a phone with a speed-dial feature, and you want to
determine which numbers to store in the speed-dial memory.  To do this,
you look at last month's bill, and decide to use the numbers that appear
most frequently on the bill.
<P>


Create a class NewPhone that contains the method bestNumbers, which
takes three arguments: <code>numbers</code>: a
<code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code> representing all the
numbers you called last month.  Each string has the form "NNN-NNN-NNNN",
where N is a numerical digit ('0'-'9').  <code>frequencies</code>: 
A <code>tvector&lt;int&gt;</code>
indicating how many times each number was called last month.  Element i
of this tvector maps to element i of the <code>numbers</code> tvector.  
<code>spaces</code>: The number
of memory spaces available to use.
<P>
The method should return a <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code> 
of the numbers to program
into the memory spaces available, starting with the most frequently
called number, and going in decreasing frequency order.  If two or more
numbers are called the same number of times, they should be returned in
the order they were in the original input.  The size of the return value
should be equal to spaces, discarding any numbers that do not fit into
the result.  If two or more numbers have the same frequency, but not all
of them will fit in the result, add the ones that were first in the
original input (See example 3).

<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>    
<LI> Class: NewPhone
<LI> Method: bestNumberss
<LI> Parameters: <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>,
	<code>tvector&lt;int&gt;</code>, <code>int</code>
<LI> Returns: <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>
<LI> Method signature: 
<XMP>
    tvector<string> bestNumbers(const tvector<string>& numbers, 
                                const tvector<int>& frequencies, int spaces)
</XMP>
</UL>

<P>    

 <h3>Class</h3>

<XMP>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
#include "tvector.h"
class NewPhone
{
    public:
       tvector<string> bestNumbers(const tvector<string>& numbers, 
                                   const tvector<int>& frequencies, int spaces)
    {
            // fill in code here
    }
};
</XMP>

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> numbers will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> Each element in numbers will have the form "NNN-NNN-NNNN", where
	each N is a digit ('0'-'9').
<P>
<LI> There will be no repeated elements in numbers.
<P>
<LI> frequencies will have the same number of elements as numbers.
<P>
<LI> Each element of frequencies will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> spaces will be between 1 and length of numbers, inclusive.
</UL>

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
numbers = {"123-456-7890", "012-333-4455", "800-825-6699"}
frequencies = {3,2,1}
spaces = 3
</PRE>

Returns:  <code>{ "123-456-7890",  "012-333-4455",  "800-825-6699" }</code>
<P>

You made 6 calls last month, three of them were 123-456-7890, two of
them were 012-333-4455, and the last was 800-825-6699.  Given the
frequency of the numbers, they are already in the order of most frequent
to least frequent, and there are enough spaces to hold all the numbers.

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    
numbers = {"123-456-7890", "012-333-4455", "800-825-6699"}
frequencies = {3,1,2}
spaces = 3
</PRE>

Returns  <code>{ "123-456-7890",  "800-825-6699",  "012-333-4455" }</code>

<P>
Now, the second and third numbers are out of order.

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    
numbers = {"123-456-7890", "012-333-4455", "800-825-6699"}
frequencies = {3,1,2}
spaces = 2
</PRE>
<P>
Returns: <code>{ "123-456-7890",  "800-825-6699" }</code>
<P>
Now, there are only two spaces available for speed-dial numbers.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
numbers = {"123-456-7890", "012-333-4455", "800-825-6699", "333-333-3333"}
frequencies = {3,1,3,3}
spaces = 2
</PRE>
<P>
Returns:  <code>{ "123-456-7890",  "800-825-6699" }</code>
<P>
Three numbers were called with a frequency of 3.  Since the first and
third elements come before the fourth, they are programmed first, and
there is not enough room for the fourth element in the memory spaces.
