<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Most telephones today are equipped with a speed dialing facility, which
makes it possible to assign telephone numbers to single keys on your
phone - although it's usually required to press some special speed
dialing key first. However, there's usually a limit on how many numbers
you can assign to the speed dial slots, so deciding which numbers you
should assign can sometimes be tricky, if you want the optimal
assignment.
<P>

Assume that you have made a list of all phone numbers you dial, and how
many times you are dialing them each month. Now you want to find out
which phone numbers you should assign to speed dialing slots in order to
minimize the number of keys you have to press. For the purposes of this
problem, you only have to return the total number of keypresses required
if the optimal assignment is done.
<P>

In this problem, we assume that speed dialing a number takes exactly two
keypresses, while dialing a number the default way requires exactly the
same amount of keypresses as the length of the phone number. It's not
possible to speed dial a number partially (for instance, speed dialing
and then add two extra digits, or speed dialing twice to produce a
single compound number).
<P>

Create a class SpeedDial containing the method assignNumbers which takes
as parameters a 
<code>tvector&lt;int&gt; number</code> containing the phone numbers, 
a <code>tvector&lt;int&gt; howMany</code>
containing how many times you dial each number as well as an int
slots - the number of speed dialing slots your telephone has. Element i
in howMany is how many times you dial the number in element i in
number. The method should return the least number of keypresses required
to dial all the numbers in a month.
<P>
 
<h3>Definition</h3>
    
<UL>
<LI> Class: SpeedDial
<LI> Method: assignNumbers
<LI> Parameters: <code>const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp;, int</code>
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature:
<PRE>

int assignNumbers(const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp; numbers,
                  const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp; howMany,
                  int slots)
</PRE>

(be sure your method is public)
</ul>
<P>

<h3>Class</h3>

<PRE>
#include "tvector.h"
class SpeedDial
{
  public:
    int assignNumbers(const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp; numbers,
                      const tvector&lt;int&gt;&amp; howMany,
                      int slots)
    {
       // fill in code here
    }
};

</PRE>
     
<h3>Notes</h3>
<UL>
<LI> There may be more speed dialing slots than actual phone numbers. In
that case, some slots will be left unused (see example 1).
<LI> Since the numbers are given as int, they can't contain leading
	zeros. 
</UL>
<P>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> numbers will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> howMany willcontain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> numbers will contain the same number of elements as howMany.
<LI> Each element in numbers is between 1000 and 999999999, inclusive.
<LI> Each element in howMany is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
<LI> The elements in numbers are unique.
<LI> slots is between 1 and 9, inclusive.
</UL>
<P>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>

{9753,1245987,4833,34473,8733,1437}

{5,2,4,3,2,4}

4
</PRE>
Returns: 52
<P>
If we would dial all numbers without using speed dialing, the number of
keypresses required would be 4*5 + 7*2 + 4*4 + 5*3 + 4*2 + 4*4 = 89.
<P>
The number of keypresses saved if we would assign each of the numbers to
a speed dialing slot would be 10, 10, 8, 9, 4, and 8. So we should
definitely assign 9753, 1245987 and 34473 to a speed dialing slot, and
either 4833 or 1437. We would then save 10 + 10 + 9 + 8 = 37 keypresses,
so the total number of keypresses required would be 89 - 37 = 52.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

{124839,9876,43823}

{73,95,102}

5
</PRE>

Returns: 540
<P>
Here we have more slots than phone numbers, so all numbers in the list
should be assigned to speed dialing slots. The total number of
keypresses required would be 2*73 + 2*95 + 2*102 = 540.
