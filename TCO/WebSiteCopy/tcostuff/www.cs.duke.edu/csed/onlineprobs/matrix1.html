    <h1>Matrix 1, Highest Scoring Game</h1>

<em>

</em>
<p>
<hr>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Your task is to return the total score of the highest game. 
You are 
given a matrix called
<tt>scores </tt> with scores for some sport, where 
each row in the matrix represents the scores of a player on 
the team over several games and each column is the individual scores
in a game.
Thus, the entry <tt>scores[k][j]</tt> in the matrix is the number
of points scored by player <tt>k</tt> for game <tt>j</tt>. 
The total score of a game is the sum of the individual scores in the game. 
<P>


For example, suppose the game is Duke basketball,  there are 14 players on 
the team, and they have played three games so far. 
The three columns are in the matrix scores. 
<p>
<pre>
     18   12    17
     17    0    17
      9   16    23
     13   23    6
     21    9    3
      9    6    4

     16   12   17

      0    0    0
     23   12   18
     15    4    0
      0    0    2
      0    0    0
</pre>
<P>

The max score returned should be <tt> 153 </tt>, the sum of the first column,
the game with the most points.
