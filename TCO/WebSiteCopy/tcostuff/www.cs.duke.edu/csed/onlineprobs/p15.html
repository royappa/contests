<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

An essential part of circuit design and general system optimization is
critical path analysis.  On a chip, the critical path represents the
longest path any signal would have to travel during execution.  In this
problem we will be analyzing chip designs to determine their critical
path length.  The chips in this problem will not contain any cycles,
i.e. there exists no path from one component of a chip back to itself.
<P>

Given a <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code> connects representing the
wiring scheme, and a 
<code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> costs representing the cost of each
connection, your method will return the size of the most costly path
between any 2 components on the chip.  In other words, you are to find
the longest path in a directed, acyclic graph.  Element j of connects
will list the components of the chip that can be reached directly from
the jth component (0-based). Element j of costs will list the costs of
each connection mentioned in the jth element of connects.  As mentioned
above, the chip will not contain any cyclic paths.  
<P>
For example:
<PRE>
connects = {"1 2",
            "2",
            ""}
costs    = {"5 3",
            "7",
            ""}
</PRE>

In this example, component 0 connects to components 1 and 2 with costs 5
and 3 respectively.  Component 1 connects to component 2 with a cost of
7.  All connections mentioned are directed.  This means a connection
from component i to component j does not imply a connection from
component j to component i.  Since we are looking for the longest path
between any 2 components, your method would return 12.
