<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

This task is about the scoring in the first phase of the die-game
Yahtzee, where five dice are used. The score is determined by the values
on the upward die faces after a roll. The player gets to choose a value,
and all dice that show the chosen value are considered active. The score
is simply the sum of values on active dice.
<P>

Say, for instance, that a player ends up with the die faces showing 2,
2, 3, 5 and 4. Choosing the value two makes the dice showing 2 active
and yields a score of 2 + 2 = 4, while choosing 5 makes the one die
showing 5 active, yielding a score of 5.
<P>

Your method will take as input an tvector&lt;int&gt; toss, where each element
represents the upward face of a die, and return the maximum possible
score with these values.

<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Class: none used in this problem
<LI> Method: maxPoints
<LI> Parameters: tvector&lt;int&gt;
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature (see below)

</UL>

 <h3>Prototype</h3>

(be sure you have the necessary include files)

<XMP>

#include "tvector.h"

   int maxPoints(tvector<int> toss)
   {
           // fill in code here
   }

</XMP>

<P>


<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>

<LI>
toss will contain exactly 5 elements.
<P>
<LI>
Each element of toss will be between 1 and 6, inclusive.

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
{ 2, 2, 3, 5, 4 }

Returns: 5

</PRE>
The example from the text.


<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    

{ 6, 4, 1, 1, 3 }

Returns: 6


</PRE>
<P>
Selecting 1 as active yields 1 + 1 = 2, selecting 3 yields 3, selecting
4 yields 4 and selecting 6 yields 6, which is the maximum number of
points.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
{ 5, 3, 5, 3, 3 }

Returns: 10
   
</PRE>
<P>
Two 5's is better than three 3's.
</OL>
