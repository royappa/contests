<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

A psychologist wants to study instinctive route-making behavior in lab
rats. She builds a two-dimensional enclosure and places blocks (each one
foot wide and one foot deep) at random points inside the enclosure. She
then places a piece of cheese at a random point in the enclosure and a
lab rat at another random point. Here is an example setup, where a
square foot of space is represented by a period, a block is represented
by an X, the rat is represented by an R, and the piece of cheese is
represented by a C (spaces are added for easy reading):
<P>
<PRE>
. R . . .
. . X . .
. . . . X
X . X . X
. . . C .

</PRE>

Before putting the rat in the enclosure, the psychologist shows the
location of the piece of cheese to the rat. Naturally, the rat will
attempt to take a path with the shortest possible distance to the
cheese. But the rat isn't that intelligent so the rat will only move
towards the cheese and never move away from the cheese. Assume that the
rat can only move horizontally or vertically, one point at a time.  In
the above example, there are 3 possible routes the rat can take to get
to the cheese:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> East 2 points, South 4 points
<LI> South 2 points, East 2 points, South 2 points
<LI> South 4 points, East 2 points
</OL>

Create a class RatRoute that contains the method numRoutes, which takes
a <tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt> representing the configuration of the
test (each string represents one row of the maze), and returns an int
representing the number of possible routes the rat can take to get to
the cheese without ever increasing the distance between itself and the
cheese at any point on its path (see first NOTE).



<P>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<UL>

<LI>Class: RatRoute
<LI> Method: numRoutes
<LI> Parameters: tvector&lt;string&gt;
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature (be sure your method is public): 
<PRE>
int numRoutes(tvector&lt;string&gt; enc);
</PRE>
<P>
</UL>

<h3>Prototype</h3>
<PRE>
 #include &lt;string&gt;
 using namespace std;
 #include "tvector.h"

 class RatRoute
 {
   public:
     int numRoutes(tvector&lt;string&gt; enc)
     {
         // fill in this function (and others you can write)
     }
 };


</PRE>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<UL>
<LI>The distance between the rat and the cheese is the Euclidean
distance.  For example if the cheese is 4 points North of the rat and 3
points East of the rat, the distance between the rat and the cheese is
5.
<P>
<LI>
The rat cannot pass through, over or under the blocks that are in place.
<P>
<LI>
It is possible to have a configuration in which the rat can not reach
the cheese by moving only towards it(horizontally or vertically) but
could reach the cheese if it were to move away from the cheese. In such
cases, return 0.
<P>
</UL>

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> There are between 1 and 10 rows in the enclosure, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> There are between 1 and 10 columns in the enclosure, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> 
The enclosure is perfectly rectangular. That is, each element of 
<tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt> enc will be of the same length.
<P>
<LI> There are between 0 and (rows*columns-2) blocks in the enclosure,
inclusive.
<P>
<LI> There is exactly one rat.
<P>
<LI> There is exactly one piece of cheese.
<P>
<LI> Each character in each element of <tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt>
enc can only be one of the following: a period (representing a space),
an X (representing a block), an R (representing the rat), or a C
(representing the cheese).

</UL>
<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL type='0'>
<LI>
<PRE>
enc = {
".R...",
"..X..",
"....X",
"X.X.X",
"...C."}

return 3

</PRE>
The example shown above.

<LI>
<PRE>
enc = {
"...X.C",
"R....."}

return 2

</PRE>
There are 2 possible routes:
<OL>
<LI> East 5 points, North 1 point
<LI> East 4 points, North 1 point, East 1 point
</OL>

<P>

<LI>

<PRE>
enc = {
"C..X.",
".....",
"X..R.",
"....."}

 return 8
</PRE>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> North 1 point, West 1 point, North 1 point, West 2 points
<LI> North 1 point, West 2 points, North 1 point, West 1 point
<LI> North 1 point, West 3 points, North 1 point
<LI> West 1 point, North 2 points, West 2 points
<LI> West 1 point, North 1 point, West 1 point, North 1 point, West 1 point
<LI> West 1 point, North 1 point, West 2 points, North 1 point
<LI> West 2 points, North 2 points, West 1 point
<LI> West 2 points, North 1 point, West 1 point, North 1 point
</OL>


<LI>
<PRE>
enc = {
"C........R",
".........."}

  return 1

</PRE>
<P>

<LI>
<PRE>
"C",

return 0
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
enc = {

return 0

</PRE>
The only way the rat can get to the cheese is to go West 4 points, North
2 points, and East 1 point.  However, when the rat moves into the
lower-left corner, it increases the distance between itself and the
cheese, so this route does not count.
