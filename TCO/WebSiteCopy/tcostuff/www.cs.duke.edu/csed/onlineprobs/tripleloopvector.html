<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

You work in a workshop which makes garden instruments from metal. At the
end of each working day there remains a pile of scrap metal that cannot
be used to make anything useful. Because you dislike the idea of
throwing things away (even scrap metal), you decide to utilize this
metal to make some triangular picture frames that can be sold at the
local market.

Given a <tt>tvector&lt;int&gt;</tt>
of pieces where each element represents the length of a
straight metallic piece, return the number of possible different picture
frames that can be made from those pieces. Two picture frames are
considered to be identical if each of their corresponding sides is equal
in length. If no picture frames can be created from pieces then return
0.


<P>
<h3>Definition</h3>


<UL>    
<LI> Class: none used in this problem
<LI> Method: pictureFrames
<LI> Parameters: tvector&lt;int&gt;
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature:
<PRE>
int pictureFrames(tvector&lt;int&gt; pieces)
</PRE>

</UL>
<P>

<h3>Prototype</h3>
<PRE>
 #include "tvector.h"
 int pictureFrames(tvector&lt;int&gt; pieces)
 {
     // fill in body of this function
 }

</PRE>

<P>
<h3>Notes</h3>

A triangle can be formed if, and only if, for every pair of its sides
the sum of that pair is longer than the third side.

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> pieces will have between 0 and 50 elements inclusive.
<P>
<LI> Each element in pieces will be between 1 and 10000 inclusive.
<P>
<LI> pieces will not have any repeated elements.
<P>
</UL>

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL type='0'>
<LI>
<PRE>

{1,2,3,4,5}

Returns: 3

    
</PRE>
We can form picture frames with the following sides: {2, 3, 4}, {2, 4,
5} and {3, 4, 5}. So we can form 3 different picture frames.
<P>

<LI>
<PRE>


{8,5,3}

Returns: 0

</PRE>
8 + 5 is longer than 3 and 8 + 3 is longer than 5, but 5 + 3 is not
longer than 8. Thus we cannot form a single picture frame from these
pieces.  2)

<P>

<LI>

<PRE>

{4,23,76,22,87,3,1,99}

Returns: 7

</PRE>
<P>

<LI>
<PRE>


{10000,9999,9998,9997,9996,1,2,3,4,5}

Returns: 43


</PRE>

<LI>
<PRE>

{100}

Returns: 0

</PRE>

We cannot form any picture frames with just one piece of metal.

</OL>
