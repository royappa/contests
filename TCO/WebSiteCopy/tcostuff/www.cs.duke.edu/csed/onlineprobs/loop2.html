<h3>Problem Statement</h3>


You are looking for a place to park your car on a suburban street. You
can park at any position that meets the following requirements:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>	It is not directly in front of a private driveway.
<LI>	It is not directly in front of a bus stop.
<LI>	It is not 5 meters before a bus stop.
<LI>	It is not 10 meters before a bus stop.
<LI>	It is not directly in front of a side-street.
<LI>	It is not 5 meters before a side-street.
<LI>	It is not 5 meters after a side-street.
</OL>
<P>
The street will be represented as a string, where each character
describes a section of the street 5 meters in length. So the first
character describes the first 5 meters of the street, the second
character describes the next 5 meters and so on. street will use 'D' for
driveway, 'B' for bus stop, 'S' for side-street and '-' for all other
sections of the street. A position is directly in front of an object if
it has the same index as the object in street. A position is before an
object if its index is lower than the index of the object in
street. Finally, a position is after an object if its index is higher
than the index of the object in street.
<P>
Given the street return the total number of possible parking spaces on
that street.
