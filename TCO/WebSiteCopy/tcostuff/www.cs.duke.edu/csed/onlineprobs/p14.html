<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

You are writing software to help someone understand their very
complicated family.  Your task is to determine all aunts and uncles of a
given person.  An aunt or uncle of a person is defined as a sibling of
that person's parent.  Two people are siblings if they have one or more
parents in common.
<P>
Create a class AuntUncle that contains a method list which receives a
<code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>, 
with each element containing a record of a person's birth - in
the form of "PARENT1 PARENT2 CHILD" (quotes for clarity only), and a
single String with the target person's name, and returns a 
<code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code> of
all aunts and uncles for that target person, sorted alphabetically.
<P>



<P> 
<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Class: AuntUncle
<LI> Method: list
<LI> Parameters: <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>, <code>string</code>
<LI> Returns: <code>tvector&lt;string&gt;</code>
<LI> Method signature (see below, be sure your method is public):  

</UL>

 <h3>Class</h3>

<XMP>
#include<string>
using namespace std;
#include "tvector.h"
class AuntUncle
{
 public:
   tvector<string> list(const tvector<string>& parents, const string& target)
   {
           // fill in code here
   }
};
</XMP>

<P>
<h3>Notes</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Gender of the people is not to be considered.  In other words,
parents A and B could have a child together, as could parents A and C,
as well as parents B and C - even though this would be impossible
normally, since at least one of those pairings would result in two
people of the same gender.
<LI> Under no circumstances will the correct answer include the target.
<LI> Under no circumstances will the correct answer include either of
the actual parents of the target.
</UL>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

Inputs are valid (you don't need to check) if all of
the following criteria are met:
<UL>
<LI> <code>parents</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> Each element in <code>parents</code> 
will be in the form of <code>"parent1 parent2 child"</code>  (quotes for
	clarity).

<LI> Each element in <code>parents</code> 
will not contain leading/trailing spaces.
<LI> Each item in each element of <codedparents</code> 
(parent1, parent2, and child) 
will be at least 1 character, and at most 10 characters, in length.
<LI> Each item in each element of <code>parents</code> 
(parent1, parent2, and child) will contain only capital letters
('A'-'Z').
<LI> 
Each item in each element of <code>parents</code> (parent1, parent2, and
child) will be separated by exactly one space.

<LI> Each element in <code>parents</code> 
will not contain repeated names.  That is,
parent1, parent2, and child will all be different names.
<LI> No ancestral loops will occur in <code>parents</code>.  In other
words, someone cannot be both a descendant and an ancestor of the same
person.
<LI> No one will be listed as a child in more than one element in
<code>parents</code>.  A person can only have one pair of parents.


<LI> String target will contain only capital letters ('A'-'Z').
<LI> String target will be between 1 and 10 characters in length,
inclusive.

<LI>
String target will be contained as an item 
(either parent1, parent2, or
child) in at least one element of <code>parents.</code>
</UL>
<P>

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

In each of these examples, quotes ('"'), commas (','), and curly braces ('{'
and '}') are included for clarity only.  They are never part of the input or
output.


<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
parents = {"JOE JANE ROB"}
target = "ROB"
</PRE>

Returns:  {}
<P>
Target "ROB"'s parents do not have parents, let alone siblings.  "ROB"
has no uncles or aunts.

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    
parents = {"JOE MARY FRANK", "BOB JANE MARTHA", "FRANK MARTHA ROB", 
           "BOB AMANDA TROY"}
target = "ROB"
</PRE>
<P>
Returns: {"TROY"}
<P>
Target "ROB"'s parent "MARTHA" has a parent "BOB" who has a child other
than either of "ROB"'s parents.  This child is named "TROY", and must be
"ROB"'s Uncle (or Aunt).

<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
parents = {"HECTOR DANA ROB", "ROB MARY JOE", "JOE MARY FRANK"}
target = "FRANK"
</PRE>
Returns:{}
<P>
Target "FRANK"'s parent "MARY" is also his parent "JOE"'s parent.  Be careful
you don't think "FRANK" is his own Uncle (or Aunt).
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
parents = {"A B E", "C D F", "E F G", "A P Z", "B P Y", "C P X", "D P W", 
           "A B V", "B C U", "A C T", "B D S", "A D R", "B C Q"}
target = "G"
</PRE>

return: {"Q", "R", "S", "T", "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z"}
<P>
Note that the answer is sorted alphabetically.

</OL>
