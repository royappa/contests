<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

January 1 is the first day of any year.  February 1 is always the 32nd
day of any year.  March 1 is either the 60th or 61st day of a year
depending on whether the year is a leap year. 

<P>

Given two integer values:
a number between 1 and 365 (or 366 for a leap year) representing
a specific date, and a year,
your function will return a string "Sunday", "Monday", ... or
"Saturday" (quotes for clarity) that is the day of the week on
which the specified date occurs.

<P>
For example, given <code> 1 2003 </code> your method should return 
<code>"Wednesday"</codE> since January 1 of 2003 is a Wednesday.
