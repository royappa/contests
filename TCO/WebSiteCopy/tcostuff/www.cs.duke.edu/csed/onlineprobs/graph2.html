    <h1>Graph 1, Word Ladders II</h1>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

A <em>word ladder</em> is a sequence of words in which each word can be
transformed into the next word by changing one letter. For example, the
word ladder below changes 'lot' to 'log'.
<PRE>
   lot dot dog log
</PRE>
This is not the shortest word-ladder between 'lot' and 'log' since the
    former can be immediately changed to the latter yielding a word
    ladder of length two:
<PRE>
  lot log
</PRE>
The first and last words in a word ladder are the <em>anchor rungs</em>
    of the ladder. Any other words are <em>interior rungs</em>. For
    example, there are three interior rungs in the ladder below
between 'smile' and 'evote'.
<PRE>
   smile smite smote emote evote
</PRE>
In this problem you'll write a method that has parameters representing
potential interior rungs: a vector of strings (these by nonsense or
English words), and the anchor rungs --- two strings.  Your code must
determine the shortest word ladder between the anchor rungs that uses at
least one interior rung, and the number of such ladders. Return a vector
containing two ints: the first is the length of the shortest valid word
ladder and the second is the number of shortest ladders. If there are no
valid ladders return [0,0].


<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>    
<LI> Class: WordLadder
<LI> Method: solve
      <LI> Parameters: <code>const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; </code>
      <code>const string&amp;</code>, <code>const string&amp;</code>
<LI> Returns: <code> tvector&lt;int&gt;</code>
<LI>Method signature: 
<PRE>
   tvector&lt;int&gt; solve(const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; words,
                       const string&amp; from, const string&amp; to);
</PRE>

(be sure your method is public)
</UL>
<P>    

 <h3>Class</h3>


<XMP>
class WordLadder
{
    public:

      tvector<int> solve(const tvector<string>& words, 
                         const string& from, const string& to)
      {
            // fill in code here
      }
};
</XMP>

<h3>Notes</h3>

The parameters <tt>from</tt> and <tt>to</tt> are the anchor rungs, they
    must be connected by at least one interior rung from <tt>words</tt>
    or there are no valid word ladders.

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> <tt>words</tT> contains at most 50 words.
<P>
<LI> All strings contain only lowercase, alphabetic characters.
<P>
<LI> All strings in <tt>word</tT> are the same length and are the
same length as <tt>from</tt> and <tt>to</tt>.
<P>
</UL>


<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
[hot, dot, dog] hit cog 
</PRE>

Returns [5, 1] 
<P>
The only ladder is <tt>hit hot dot dog cog</tt> which has length five.
<P>

<LI>
<PRE>
[hot, dot, dog, lot, log] hit cog 
</PRE>
Returns [5, 2]
<P>
Now there are two length-five ladders:
<PRE>
  hit hot dot dog cog
  hit hot lot log cog
</PRE>
<LI>
<PRE>
[rain, ruin, gain, grin, grit, main, pain, pair, pail, mail] sail ruip 
</PRE>

Returns: [6, 2]
<P>
There are two ladders of length six and no shorter ladders.
<PRE>
  sail mail main rain ruin ruip
  sail pail pain rain ruin ruip
</PRE>
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
[most, mist, fist, fish,] lost cost 
</PRE>
Returns [3, 1]
<P>
Although <tt>lost</tt> is directly connected to <tt>cost</tt>, a
valid word ladder must contain an interior rung so the shortest ladder
	  is
<PRE>
   lost most cost
</PRE>
<LI>
<PRE>
[mist, fist, fish,] lost cost 
</PRE>
Returns [0, 0]
<P>
Although <tt>lost</tt> is directly connected to <tt>cost</tt>, a
valid word ladder must contain an interior rung, there is no such ladder.

</OL>
