<h3>Problem Statement</h3>


Many times, certain data file types can consist of large amounts of
repeated data. For instance, images can have large runs of the same
color. This can be easily compressed using a technique called run length
encoding. With run length encoding, large amounts of repeated data are
stored as the repeated data and the number of times to repeat it.
<P>
Create a class RunLengthEncode that contains the method encode which
takes one argument: a <tt>string</tt> to be encoded as described below.
<P>
The return value should be a <tt>string</tt> 
which has been encoded with the following algorithm:
<P>

If any character is repeated more than 4 times, the entire set of
repeated characters should be replaced with a slash '/', followed by a
2-digit number which is the length of the set of characters, and the
character. For example, "aaaaa" would be encoded as "/05a". Runs of 4 or
less characters should not be replaced since performing the encoding
would not decrease the length of the string.
<P>

<P> 
<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>    
<LI> Class: RunLengthEncode
<LI> Method: encode
<LI> Parameters: <code>string</code>
<LI> Returns: <code>string</code>
<LI>Method signature: 
<PRE>
    string encode(const string&amp; input)
</PRE>

(be sure your method is public)
<P>    

 <h3>Class</h3>


<XMP>

#include<string>
using namespace std;

class RunLengthEncode
{
    public:
      string encode(const string& input)
      {
            // fill in code here
      }
};
</XMP>

<P>
<h3>Notes</h3

<UL>
<LI> Letters are case sensitive. For example "AaAaAa" cannot be encoded.
<P>
<LI> You may only encode repeats of a single character, repeats of multiple
characters cannot be encoded. For example "ababababab" cannot be encoded
as "/05ab".

</UL>

<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> input will have between 0 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> input will consist only of letters 'a' - 'z' and 'A' - 'Z', digits '0'
- '9', the space character, and the characters in the following string:
"{}[]():;'+=.,". (quotes are for clarity only and cannot be in the input
string)
</UL>

<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
input = "aaaaa"

</PRE>

Returns:  "/05a"
<P>

The example stated above.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    

input = "aaaa"

</PRE>

Returns: "aaaa"
<P>
Remember not to encode runs of length 4 or less.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>    

input = "abcabcabcabcabc"
</PRE>
<P>
Returns: "abcabcabcabcabc"
<P>
Do not encode repeated segments of more than one character
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

input = "if(a){if(b){if(c){if(d){if(e){5 deeeeeeep}}}}}"

</PRE>
<P>
Returns: "if(a){if(b){if(c){if(d){if(e){5 d/07ep/05}"
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

input = ""
</PRE>
<P>
Returns: ""
</OL>
