<h3>Problem Statement</h3>


Prior to 1971, Britain used a system of coins that can be traced back to
the tim e of Charlemagne.  The three main units of coinage were the
penny, the shilling, and the pound.  There were 12 pennies in a shilling
and 20 shillings in a pound.  Given a number pence of pennies, convert
this amount into pounds, shillings, and pennies by first converting as
many pennies as possible into pounds, and then converting as many of the
rema ining pennies as possible into shillings.  Return a 
tvector&lt;int&gt; of
size three containing the number of pounds, the number of shillings, and
the number of pennies, in that order.
