<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>

The Stanford Office of Student Affairs has been placing student groups
(including the one, the only, the truly incomparable, Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band) on alcohol probation.  However, due to
some legal nitpicking, they are only allowed to place a group on alcohol
probation if it throws 3 parties in a given year.
<P>

Given a tvector &lt;string&gt;, schedule, which represents which group
throws a party on each day, return a string of the first group that
becomes legally eligible for alcohol probation.  Each element of
schedule will represent one day.  If the same group throws 3 or more
parties, it becomes legally eligible for alcohol probation.

If no group becomes legally eligible for alcohol probation, return "".




<h3>Definition</h3>

<UL>
<LI> Class:Alcohol
<LI> Method:punish
<LI> Parameters:tvector &lt;string&gt;
<LI> Returns:string
<LI> Method signature:
<PRE>

  string punish(const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; schedule)

</PRE>
(be sure your method is public)
</UL>
<P>

<h3>Class</h3>
<PRE>
 #include &lt;string&gt;
 using namespace std;
 #include "tvector.h"
 class Alcohol
 {
     public:
       string punish(const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp; schedule)
       {
           // fill in body of this function
       }
 };
</PRE>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> If no group becomes legally eligible for alcohol probation, return "".
<LI> Element 0 of schedule represents day 0, element 1 represents day 1, and so on.  Thus, each day, there is exactly one group that throws a party.
</UL>
<P>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<UL>
<LI> schedule will contain between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> each element of schedule will contain 1 to 10 characters, inclusive.
<LI> each element of schedule will only contain capital letters [A-Z].
</UL>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>

{"LSJUMB","SAE","AEP","SAE","LSJUMB","LSJUMB","AEP","LSJUMB"}

Returns: "LSJUMB"

</PRE>

LSJUMB throws 4 parties, while SAE and AEP throw only 2.  Therefore LSJUMB is the only group that is legally eligible for alcohol probation.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

{"LSJUMB","SAE","SAE","LSJUMB","LSJUMB","SAE","AEP","AEP","AEP"}

</PRE>

Returns: "LSJUMB"
<P>
All 3 groups throw 3 parties, so they are all eligible for alcohol probation.  The order in which they become eligible is "LSJUMB", "SAE", "AEP".
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>

{"KA","SX","TAXI","TAXI","SX","SX","KA","TAXI","KA","KA","TAXI","KA",
 "TAXI","ST","KA","KA","KA","KA","KA","SX","SX","SX","SX","SX"}
</PRE>
