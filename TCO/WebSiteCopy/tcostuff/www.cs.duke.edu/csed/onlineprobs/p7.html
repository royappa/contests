<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    

If you want to write a message anonymously, one way to do it is to cut
out letters from headlines in a newspaper and paste them onto a blank
piece of paper to form the message you want to write. Given several
headlines that you have cut out, determine how many messages from a list
you can write using the letters from the headlines. You should only
consider each message by itself and not in conjunction with the others,
see example 2.
<P>

Create a class <tt>Anonymous</tt> which contains the method
<tt>howMany</tt> which takes as parameters a
<tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt> <tt>headlines</tt> containing the
headlines which you have cut out as well as a
<tt>tvector&lt;string&gt;</tt> <tt>messages</tt> with the messages you
may want to write, and returns an int which is the total number of
messages you can write.
 <P>

<h3>Definition</h3>
    
<UL>
<LI> Class: Anonymous
<LI> Method: howMany
<LI> Parameters: <code>const tvector&lt;string&gt&amp;</code>, 
<code>const tvector&lt;string&gt;&amp;</code> 
<LI> Returns: int
<LI> Method signature
<XMP>
int howMany(const tvector<string>& headlines, const tvector<string>& messages)
</XMP>
</UL>
(be sure your method is public)
<P>
<h3>Class</h3>

<XMP>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
#include "tvector.h"

class Anonymous 
{
    public:
      int howMany(const tvector <string>& headlines, 
                  const tvector <string>& messages) 
      {
            // fill in code here
      }
};

</XMP>     
<P>

<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>
<UL>

<LI> All letters that you cut out can be used both as upper or lower case in
    a message.
<LI> Spaces should be ignored in elements in both headlines
    and messages. 
<P>
<LI> headlines will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> messages
    will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<LI> The length of
    each element in headlines will be between 1 and 50 characters,
    inclusive.
<LI> The length of each element in messages will be between 1
    and 50 characters, inclusive.
<LI> Each element in headlines will only
    contain the letters 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z' and space.
<LI> Each element in
    messages will only contain the letters 'A'-'Z', 'a'-'z' and space. 
</UL>
<P>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
headlines =

{"Earthquake in San Francisco",
 "Burglary at musuem in Sweden",
 "Poverty"}

messages =

{"Give me my money back",
 "I am the best coder",
 "TOPCODER"}
</PRE>

Returns: 2
<P>
In the first message we have three 'm's, but there are only two 'm's
among the headlines (both in the word "museum"), so this message can't
be written.
<P>
The second message can be written. Note that the first letter, 'I', only
appears as lower case in the headlines, but that's allowed. The last
message can also be written, so the method should return 2.  
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
headlines = 

        {"Programming is fun"}

messages = 

        {"program","programmer","gaming","sing","NO FUN"}
</PRE>
Returns: 4
<P>
The messages "program", "gaming", "sing" and "NO FUN" can all be written
    but not "programmer" (no 'e's exist). The method should return 4.
<P>
<LI>
<PRE>
headlines = 

   {"abcdef","abcdef"}

messages = 

   {"AaBbCc","aabbbcc","   ","FADE"}
</PRE>

Returns: 3
<P>
All messages except the second one can be written, because it contains
three 'b's but there are only two 'b's available. Also note the message
only containing spaces - such a message can of course always be written.
<P>
</OL>
