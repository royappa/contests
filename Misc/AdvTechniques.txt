Binary search / bisection : TCO2007R1C_1_500.txt

Ternary search to find max/min of a function which first decreases and then increase (or vice versa). Need not be convex but must be "unimodal"

BFS
	Multistate BFS
DFS
	Multistate DFS
	Flood fill
Floyd (all pairs shortest paths)
Warshall (transitive closure)
Brute Force:
	Nested Loops (various types/gotchas)
	Backtracking (try to place / un-place each item in turn, then go to next level)
	All permutations with next_permutation()   (watch out if there are dupes in the input, next_permutation() won't do n! cases - need to map)
	All subsets using masks
	All partitions
	Permutation cycles (?)
Memoization (pure recursive function, most likely with scalar params, but try simple vector params too, or vector encoded as numeric)
Dynamic Programming (for things like subset-sum problem, if it seems like the recursion depth would be too much)


	
	
Floating point
	- Use long double internally then convert to double?
	- Use rational math, but rember to use long long since the multiplications may overflow
	
Misc 
	Binary search: make sure interval exceeds endpoints 
	Percentage: make sure to account for div/mult by 100
