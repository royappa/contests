Problem Statement
    
You are working on the backend of a system that allows people to upload files. For security reasons, you want to restrict the file extensions of the files they upload. You will be given a String[], extensions, containing a list of allowed extensions. You will also be given a String[], files, containing the names of a number of files. Your task is to return a String[], each element of which is either "ALLOW" or "DENY", corresponding to the elements of files with the same indices. If a filename ends with a period ('.') followed by an allowed extension, ignoring case, then it is to be allowed, otherwise it should be denied.
