Problem Statement
    
The people at TopCoder invited a bunch of members to a recognition party. At the party, they arranged all of the people in a line ordered by rating. Unfortunately, they may have made mistakes. Each member will file a complaint for every person ahead of them that has a lower rating. For example: line = {1000,800,900,1400} The line is ordered front to back. The member rated 900 (position 2 in the line) will file 1 complaint since there is a member rated 800 (position 1) ahead of him. The member rated 1400 (position 3) will file 3 complaints since there are members rated 1000 (position 0), 800 (position 1), and 900 (position 2) ahead of him. In total there will be 4 (1+3) complaints. Given the list of ratings ordered front to back, you will determine how many complaints TopCoder will receive. Create a class Complaints that contains the method howMany, which takes an int[] line and returns an int that represents the number of complaints TopCoder will receive.
