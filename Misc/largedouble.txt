Problem Statement
    
You have implemented a sorting algorithm that requires exactly c*n*lg(n) nanoseconds to sort n integers. Here lg denotes the base-2 logarithm. Given time nanoseconds, return the largest double n such that c*n*lg(n) <= time.
Definition
    
Class:
SortEstimate
Method:
howMany
Parameters:
int, int
Returns:
double
Method signature:
double howMany(int c, int time)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
lg(n) = ln(n)/ln(2) where ln denotes the natural log.
-
Your return value must have a relative or absolute error less than 1e-9.
Constraints
-
c will be between 1 and 100 inclusive.
-
time will be between 1 and 2000000000 inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
1
8
Returns: 4.0
Given 8 nanoseconds we can sort 4 integers since
	1*4*lg(4) = 4*2 = 8
1)

    
2
16
Returns: 4.0
Now that c = 2 we need twice as many nanoseconds to sort 4 integers.
2)

    
37
12392342
Returns: 23104.999312341137
We can almost sort 23105 integers, but not quite.
3)

    
1
2000000000
Returns: 7.637495090348122E7
Largest possible return.
