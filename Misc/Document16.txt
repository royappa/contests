Problem Statement
    
You are given a goal word as a string matchString and puzzle words as a vector <string> matchWords. The number of puzzle words is equal to the number of letters in the goal word. Assume all letters in all words have the same width and height.
 
You want to play a game. At the beginning of the game, all the words from matchWords are arranged one below another, in the order that they're given. The words are horizontally aligned so that the first letters of all the words form a vertical line. You may then shift each of the words any number of places (zero or more) to the right, where one place is the width of a single letter. The goal of the game is to shift the puzzle words such that the goal word can be read vertically from top to bottom in a straight line. See examples for clarification.
 
Your score is the sum of the number of places each puzzle word was shifted. Return the minimal score you can obtain while achieving your goal, or -1 if it is impossible.

Examples
0)

    
"TOP"
{"TIK", 
 "PPPO", 
 "OP"}
Returns: 5
The final arrangement is
   TIK
PPPO
  OP
The first word is shifted 3 places, and the last word is shifted 2 places. In this arrangement, the goal word can be read vertically in the fourth column from the right (shown in bold).
1)

    
"EEA"
{"GEGA", 
 "TOPCODER", 
 "TEST"}
Returns: -1
The puzzle words must be used in the order they are given, so it is impossible to form the goal word in this case.
2)

    
"AB"
{"ABA", 
 "ABAB"}
Returns: 1
One possible arrangement is
 ABA
ABAB
3)

    
"FIND"
{"VERYFAST", 
 "OPINION", 
 "SPENDING", 
 "ODD"}
Returns: 3
VERYFAST
OPINION
 SPENDING
  ODD
4)

    
"TOP"
{"OUTTHERE", 
 "FROM", 
 "NOPQRSTU"}
Returns: 0
The final arrangement can be made without shifting at all:
OUTTHERE
FROM
NOPQRSTU
