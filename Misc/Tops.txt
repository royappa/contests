This summary is probably unnecessary, but I said I would tabulate, so here it is. I took dok's top 3 and counted that as the "community vote".

By popular acclaim, SnapDragon's code is the most educational, entertaining and just plain cool. :-)

See dok's postings above, for various other coders that the community likes to review.

Thanks everyone for the useful/entertaining info.
