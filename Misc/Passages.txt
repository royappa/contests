Problem Statement
    
Bloggo lets content producers integrate a text-search facility into their weblogs, making it easy for end users to sift through archival content. One type of query offered by the bloggo search engine is the sequence search. In such a query, consecutive words are separated by an ellipsis, "...". The query matches strings in which all words of the query appear, in the same order as they are given in the query. Such a string, called a passage, begins with the first word of the query and ends with the last word of the query. For example, the sequence-search query

  with...here...there
matches the following passages.

  With a quack-quack here and a quack-quack there

  With an oink-oink here and an oink-oink there

  With a moo-moo here and a moo-moo there
Observe that matching is not case-sensitive. Also bear in mind that words are defined as sequences of alphabetic characters, 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z', that are not included in a longer word. Thus, the query shown above does not match either of the following passages in part or in whole.

  without a woof-woof here or a woof-woof there

  with a meow-meow here and a meow-meow thereabouts
  
In the special case of a single-word query, a matching passage is also one word long. The query

  pudding
therefore matches passages that look like this.

  pudding
In general, a query word must appear in a matching passage at least as many times as it appears in the query. Thus, the query

  a...quack...quack...night
does not match

  a quack in the night
but it does match both of the following.

  a quack in the quack factory at night

  a quack doctor said quack quack last night
  
You are given a String[], documents, each element of which contains a single document. 

A document may include, in addition to words and spaces, the punctuation symbols ',', ';', '.', '!', '?', '-', '(', and ')'. 

You are also given a String, query, consisting of one or more words separated by ellipses. 

Find the top five passages matching this query and return them in a String[] formatted according to the specifications below and sorted by descending order of quality, where quality is also defined below. 

Each passage must be a substring of an element of documents, and must begin and end with a whole word.

The shorter a passage, the higher its quality. 

The length of a passage is counted in characters, and a passage extends from the first character of the first query word to the last character of the last query word. 

If two passages are equally long, the one drawn from the lower-numbered document takes precedence. 

In the case of equally long passages in the same document, earlier ones are better. 

Passages may overlap. 

If there are fewer than five matching passages among the documents, return the ones that do exist. 

To make the search results helpful to users, each passage should be presented in the format

  DOC_ID START_INDEX [PASSAGE_TEXT]
  
where DOC_ID is the zero-based index of the document from which the passage is drawn, START_INDEX is the zero-based character index of the first character in the passage, and PASSAGE_TEXT is the text of the passage. There is one space between DOC_ID and START_INDEX, one space between START_INDEX and the left bracket, and no other spaces except possibly in the PASSAGE_TEXT.

These documents are fragments of the Gettysburg Address. Observe that word matching is case-insensitive and that passages may overlap.
