Problem Statement
    
We have p people, x small packs, and y large packs. A packhorse can carry one of the following loads. It is not possible to have a horse carry a mixture of small and large packs.
3 or fewer small packs
2 or fewer large packs
a person and 2 or fewer small packs
a person and 1 large pack
We need to know the fewest horses that we can use to handle our people and packs. Create a class Packhorse that contains a method horses that is given p, x, and y and returns the smallest number of horses that can carry the load.
