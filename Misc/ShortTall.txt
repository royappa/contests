Problem Statement
    
A group of people stand before you arranged in rows and columns. Looking from above, they form an R by C rectangle of people. You will be given a String[] people containing the height of each person. Elements of people correspond to rows in the rectangle. Each element contains a space-delimited list of integers representing the heights of the people in that row. Your job is to return 2 specific heights in a int[]. 

The first is computed by finding the shortest person in each row, and then finding the tallest person among them (the "tallest-of-the-shortest"). 

The second is computed by finding the tallest person in each column, and then finding the shortest person among them (the "shortest-of-the-tallest").
Definition
    
Class:
TallPeople
Method:
getPeople
Parameters:
String[]
Returns:
int[]
Method signature:
int[] getPeople(String[] people)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
people will contain between 2 and 50 elements inclusive.
-
Each element of people will contain between 3 and 50 characters inclusive.
-
Each element of people will be a single space-delimited list of positive integers such that: 1) Each positive integer is between 1 and 1000 inclusive with no extra leading zeros. 2) Each element contains the same number of integers. 3) Each element contains at least 2 positive integers. 4) Each element does not contain leading or trailing whitespace.
Examples
0)

    
{"9 2 3",
 "4 8 7"}
Returns: { 4,  7 }
The heights 2 and 4 are the shortest from the rows, so 4 is the taller of the two. The heights 9, 8, and 7 are the tallest from the columns, so 7 is the shortest of the 3.
1)

    
{"1 2",
 "4 5",
 "3 6"}
Returns: { 4,  4 }

2)

    
{"1 1",
 "1 1"}
Returns: { 1,  1 }
