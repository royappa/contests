Problem Statement
    
The base of a number system is the number of different values each digit can represent. For example, in base-2 (binary), there are 2 values each digit can take: 0 and 1. In base-10, a digit can take values 0 through 9, inclusive. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine which base a numerical expression is in. An equation is valid for a given base if all of the digits are less than the base, and the numerical meaning of the equation is correct. For example, "1+1=10" for base-10 satisfies the rule that the digits are all less than 10, but 1+1 = 2 in base-10, so the equation is not correct for base-10.
If we assume that the characters '0'-'9' represent the values 0 - 9, and the characters 'A'-'J' represent the values 10 - 19, then we can represent numbers with a base up to 20. The equation will be in the following form:
<num>+<num>=<num>
Where each <num> is a String consisting of characters '0'-'9' and 'A'-'J', which does not have any extra leading zeros, and is at most 5 digits long.
Given an equation as defined above, you should return which bases in the range of 2 to 20, inclusive, are valid for the equation. Return the bases in a int[] in ascending order.
Definition
    
Class:
BaseMystery
Method:
getBase
Parameters:
String
Returns:
int[]
Method signature:
int[] getBase(String equation)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
equation will be of the form "<num>+<num>=<num>"
-
Each <num> in equation will have between 1 and 5 characters, inclusive.
-
Each <num> in equation will consist only of numeric digits '0' - '9' and capital letters 'A' - 'J', and will not have extra leading zeros.
Examples
0)

    
"1+1=2"
Returns: 
{ 3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,  18,
  19,  20 }
The only base which this does not work for is base-2. In base 2, 2 is represented by "10"
1)

    
"1+1=10"
Returns: { 2 }
The same equation valid for base 2.
2)

    
"1+1=3"
Returns: { }
1+1 is never 3, no matter what base you are in.
3)

    
"ABCD+211=B000"
Returns: { 14 }
In base-14, the digits are 0-9, A-D. Adding one to the ones column yields 10 base-14, which carries over to make the 10's column a 'D'. Adding 1 to that column yields 10 again, which carries and makes the 100's column a 'C'. Adding 2 to C yields 10 again, which adds 1 to the 1000's column, resulting in B000.
4)

    
"ABCD+322=B000"
Returns: { 15 }
For base-15, we have increased the number required to wrap to 0 by 1.
5)

    
"1+0=1"
Returns: 
{ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,
  18,  19,  20 }
This is valid for all bases.
6)

    
"GHIJ+1111=HJ00"
Returns: { 20 }

7)

    
"1234+8765=9999"
Returns: { 10,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15,  16,  17,  18,  19,  20 }
