Problem Statement
    
You have been hired to do some refactoring. 

You are not really sure what that is, but you think it has something to do with factoring a number multiple times.  

Recall that a factorization of a positive integer n is a collection of at least two positive integers, each larger than one, whose product is n. 

Note that the order of the numbers in a factorization is ignored, so 2*12 and 12*2 represent the same factorization of 24.

In fact, 24 has precisely 6 valid factorizations: 2*2*2*3, 2*2*6, 2*3*4, 2*12, 3*8, and 4*6.  

To prepare for your job, write a program that, given an int n, returns the number of unique factorizations of n.
Definition
    
Class:
Refactoring
Method:
refactor
Parameters:
int
Returns:
int
Method signature:
int refactor(int n)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Constraints
-
n will be between 2 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive.
Examples
0)

    
24
Returns: 6
This is the example from the problem statement.
1)

    
9973
Returns: 0
9973 is a prime number, so there are no valid factorizations of 9973.
2)

    
9240
Returns: 295

3)

    
1916006400
Returns: 7389115
The number of factorizations will never be larger than this.
