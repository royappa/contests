<p align="justify"><b> 2004-10-16 20:44:51 SPOJ Bulletin, issue 5 </b> by <b> Adrian Kosowski </b> <br>
<DIV align="justify">
This edition of the SPOJ Bulletin comprises a list of all major changes which 
		have appeared in Sphere Online Judge since the previous issue.
	<p>Changes in October:
		<ul>
			<li>
			At last, Sphere Online Judge WWW server is running on a new PC! It should be 
			incomparably faster and more stable.
			<li>
				The opening problemset of this year's <A href="http://liga.sphere.pl/">DASM 
					Programming League</A> has been made available (problems: <A href="problems/SOPARADE.html">
					SOPARADE</A>, <A href="problems/CUTSQRS.html">CUTSQRS</A>, <A href="problems/PHRASES.html">
					PHRASES</A>, <A href="problems/PSPHERE.html">PSPHERE</A>, <A href="problems/PAWNS/index.html">
					PAWNS</A>). The deadline for submitting solutions is 27.10, but the sooner 
				you solve a problem, the better. You are welcome to write to the <A href="https://spoj.sphere.pl/forum/viewforum.php?f=40">
					forum</A>
			in case of any doubts.
			<li>
			MS-Word, pdf and PostScript "languages" have been added. At present, they are 
			not meant for use in any of the publicly available SPOJ problems ;)
			<li>
				From now on, bearing in mind the upcoming contest support in the online judge, 
				solutions will be tested on <I>4 identical PII266 computers</I>. All 
			solutions have been rejudged on the online judge's new PCs. Time limits were 
			arbitrarily changed, generally more TLE turned into AC than vice versa ;)
			<li>
				The Nemerle compiler in SPOJ has been upgraded to version 0.2.1.</li>
		</ul>
	<P>Changes in September:
		<ul>
			<li>
			The Ocaml compiler in SPOJ has been upgraded from version 3.07a to 3.08.1.
			<li>
				The Nemerle language (<A href="http://www.nemerle.org/">http://www.nemerle.org/</A>) 
			has been added to Sphere Online Judge.
			<li>
			The C# compiler and .NET virtual machine in SPOJ have been upgraded to mono 
			1.0.1.
			<li>
			The site search function has been integrated and enhanced.
			<li>
			The site structure has been reordered and in consequence document URLs should 
			now be more intuitive.
			<li>
			PS and PDF versions of individual problems and of the whole problemset have 
			been made available for download.
			<li>
			Memory used by submitted solutions at runtime is now displayed in the status.
			<li>
			The general look-and-feel of SPOJ has been somewhat altered. Visual alterations 
			have been introduced (if these are not immediately apparent,
			<li>
			SPOJ has been assigned its own IP address and https connections now go through 
			standard port 443 (at last).
			<li>
			The program for sending submission confirmations has been rewritten from 
			scratch.
			<li>
			An important change has been introduced: from now on, a program has to exit 
			with exit code 0 to get AC. It will get Runtime Error: NZEC otherwise. We 
			believe it's better this way.
			<li>
				The PHP language has been added to the online judge. The interpreter is PHP 
				4.3.8-9, cli version.</li>
		</ul>
	<P>Changes in August:
		<ul>
			<li>
			The Bash language has been added to the online judge, along with some standard 
			Linux tools.
			<li>
				Submissions in C# language are now supported by Sphere Online Judge. The 
				compiler and .net bytecode interpreter are from mono 0.30.2 (<A href="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com</A>).
			<li>
			Old Blackdown Java with green threads has been replaced with Sun's Java 1.5.0b2 
			with native threads. Java, Nice and Bytecode programs should run much faster.
			<li>
			Since limiting programs' memory usage proved to be very difficult when allowing 
			so many language, memory limits specific for particular problems have been 
			removed and now all problems have the same, sane memory limit (you can assume 
			you have at least 64MB of physical memory at your disposal).
			<li>
				A new language has been added to SPOJ: Lua (<A href="http://www.lua.org/">http://www.lua.org</A>)
			<li>
				Two new languages have been added to SPOJ: Nice (<A href="http://nice.sourceforge.net/">http://nice.sourceforge.net</A>) 
				and java bytecode submitted directly in a JAR file (which allows users to write 
				in any language compilable to bytecode, even if not supported by the online 
				judge directly). Many thanks to Daniel Bonniot for helpful suggestions.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Plans for the weeks to come include: improving the support for contests in SPOJ, 
		making contests publicly available, as well as introducing a more advanced 
		testing model for the online judge (to allow for multiple test cases and 
		interactive testing). If you have any questions or suggestions, please write to 
		the <a href="https://spoj.sphere.pl/forum/viewforum.php?f=29">forum</a>.</p>
