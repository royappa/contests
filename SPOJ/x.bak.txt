n = yi (mod xi) 
=> n = yi+m*xi
 
n = yj (mod xj)

=> yi+m*xi = yj (mod xj)

yj-yi = m*xi (mod xj)

=> m = (yj-yi)/xi (mod xj)

When xi,xj are coprime, we can find xi's inverse mod xj and calculate m
Then, n can be calculated as above

When xi,xj are not coprime:

yj-yi = m*xi (mod xj)

=> (yj-yi)-m*xi = k*xj

=> yj-yi = k*xj+m*xi

Let g = gcd(xj,xi); divide both sides by g
 
(yj-yi)/g = k*(xj/g)+m*(xi/g)

If (yj-yi)%g != 0, then there is no solution
Otherwise, again, we can find m and all is well.
