Problem Statement
    
The digits 4 and 7 are lucky digits, and all other digits are unlucky. A third level lucky number is a positive integer that is divisible by at least one lucky digit. John and Brus have written down all the third level lucky numbers between a and b, inclusive, and now they would like to count the number of occurrences of each digit between 0 and 9, inclusive, in the numbers they have written.
Return a vector<long long> containing exactly 10 elements, where the i-th element (0-based) is the total number of occurrences of digit i.
