Problem Statement
    
The digits 4 and 7 are lucky digits, and all other digits are unlucky. A second level lucky number is a positive integer whose decimal representation contains either all 4's or all 7's. John and Brus have a set of integers, and they would like to find the subset whose sum is a second level lucky number.
You are given vector <int> numbers, the set of integers that John and Brus have. Return a vector <int> containing the subset whose sum is a second level lucky number. The return value must be sorted in ascending order. If there are multiple possible return values, return the one with the largest sum. If there is a tie, return the one that comes earliest lexicographically. A vector <int> a1 comes before a vector <int> a2 lexicographically if a1 contains a smaller number at the first index where they differ. If there are no possible subsets, return an empty vector <int> instead.

Examples
0)

    
{1, 2, 3, 4}
Returns: {1, 2, 4 }
Here it's possible to get two second level lucky numbers - 4 and 7. There are two subsets with a sum of 7 - {3, 4} and {1, 2, 4}. We will choose the last one because it is lexicographically smaller.
1)

    
{12, 43, 29}
Returns: { }
There are no subsets whose sum is a second level lucky number.
2)

    
{4, 7}
Returns: {7 }

3)

    
{41, 2, 28, 44, 7, 42, 21}
Returns: {7, 28, 42 }

4)

    
{15, 10, 28, 3, 13, 27, 7}
Returns: {7, 15, 27, 28 }

5)

    
{18, 45, 6}
Returns: { }

6)

    
{34, 20, 26, 28, 33, 23, 44, 40, 25, 10, 36, 14, 7, 29, 21, 27, 17, 13, 19, 24, 32, 41, 31}
Returns: {7, 10, 13, 14, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 44 }
